Body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) was also calculated. We measured waist circumference at the midpoint between the lower costal margin and the iliac crest. The hip circumference was measured over both trochanter majores (tangible bone on the outside of the hip joint). Waist to hip ratio was also calculated. We performed all measurements in duplicate, and, if the difference between these measurements exceeded a predefined value, a third measurement was performed. All available measurements were used to calculate means.  Heart rate, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were measured in duplicate with a Dinamap Critikon 1846SX (Critikon Inc, Tampa, FL), from which we calculated means.  At the third visit, fasting blood sample of participants were drawn for the measurement of glucose (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), insulin (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Inc, Webster, TX), HbA1c (high performance liquid chromatography, Variant, Bio-Rad), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (Roche Diagnostics) and LDL cholesterol (calculated according to Friedewald’s equation5), as well as alanine transaminase (Photometric determination according to the reference method of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC)6) and lipoprotein(a) (Nephelometric method, BN2, DadeBehring).

Of the 560 MBL cases, 396 had low-count MBL (LC-MBL) and 164 had high-count MBL (HC-MBL). Wiithin the Mayo Clinic Biobank only a subset of participants had a complete blood count. therefore the percent of clonal B-cells out of total B-cells was used to categorize participants as LC- and HC-MBL.  Based on prior evidence, those MBL individuals with a percent clonal B-cell <85% were defined as LC-MBL and those with percent clonal B-cells ≥85% as HC-MBL. Within the Mayo Clinic Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Resource, MBL was classified by LC-MBL or HC-MBL according to the B-cell clone size of below or above 0.5 × 109/L threshold, respectively.",,,,,MAYO,Possibly significant sample overlap between this dataset and the dataset used to source PRS41_CLL.

Of the 147 individuals within the LWL trajectory group, 34 underwent biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch via laparoscopy whilst 112 underwent the same procedure via open surgery. Of the 620 individuals within the HWL+NWL trajectory group, 396 underwent biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch via laparoscopy whilst 217 underwent the same procedure via open surgery. On the eve of the surgery, height and body weight were measured and used to calculate the initial BMI as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Body weight was further measured during postoperative visits or phone calls thorough a follow-up period of 8 years. Percentage of excess body weight loss (EBWL) was then calculated at each follow-up time point (3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 months) as the difference between actual body weight loss (calculated initial BMI minus actual BMI) and ideal body weight loss (calculated as the initial BMI minus ideal BMI fixed at 25 kg/m2).",,,,,,Participants were obtained from the Bariatric Surgery Clinic of the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute.
