Standard errors, sample sizes, scale (observed vs liability), and LDSC intercept/lambda_GC are not provided in the supplied text. Confidence is moderate (0.70) due to ambiguity about whether these are local vs genome-wide estimates and because key metadata (SE, N, scale) are missing."

There is an inconsistency in the manuscript where an earlier paragraph cites a stroke GWAS meta-analysis of 521,612 subjects (from ref 15) but Table 1 lists N=446,696; sample_size fields above use the Table 1 values. Confidence is moderate-low because the reported h2 values are cited from prior studies (refs 41,42) and the current paper did not provide SEs, p-values, or explicit method attribution for those percentages."

The review generally did not report standard errors, p-values, or LDSC intercept/lambda_gc values for these heritability estimates, so those fields are null. All studies reviewed were reported as European-ancestry; I set ancestry = \"European\" when the review explicitly tied the estimate to a named GWAS/sample with European participants or when the review stated all included studies were European. Scale is set to 'liability' only when the review explicitly stated liability-scale conversion or specified a prevalence (e.g., Brainstorm 17% or Baker et al. 5%); otherwise I marked 'not_specified' or 'observed' where the review explicitly said observed-scale. Confidence values reflect (a) clear single-study numeric values (higher confidence) vs (b) bounds from re-evaluations or ranges across cohorts (lower confidence). If you want me to (1) prune entries to one per original study (rather than bounds/summaries), (2) try to map each extraction to the original paper and pull missing SE/p-values/intercepts (if available), or (3) convert all liability/observed not_specified values to a unified scale given a chosen prevalence, I can do that next."
