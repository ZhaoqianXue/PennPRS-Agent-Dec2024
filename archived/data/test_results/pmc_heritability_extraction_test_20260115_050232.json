          "evidence_html": "<div class=\"evidence-snippet\">...Welch\u2019s t-test was then used to compare CD28 gene expression levels across these groups. ## Results <mark class=\"highlight\">We utilized LDSC to estimate SNP-based heritability, thereby determining the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the detected variants. Based on the summary statistics from GWAS on allergic rhinitis, the estimated heritability on the observed scale was 2.08% in the European population and 1.03% in the East Asian population. For eosinophils, the estimated heritability on the observed scale was 19.64% in Europeans and 11.14% in East Asians (Supplemental Table 2 ) . We next investigated the genetic correlations of AR and hematological traits using LDSC 36 . In Europeans, significant genetic correlations were detected between AR and eosinophils (R g = 0.28, P adjust = 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u20136 ), but no correlation was detected from erythrocytes, platelets or other WBC traits (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 3 ). In East Asians, AR is also significantly correlated with eosinophils (R g = 0.34, P adjust = 6.4 \u00d7 10 \u20133 ). Besides, we observed negative correlations between AR and monocytes (R g = -0.30, P adjust = 0.02), pollinosis and neutrophils (R g = -0.25, P adjust = 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u20133 ) and pollinosis and leukocytes (R g = -0.24, P adjust = 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u20134 ). We further performed partitioned genetic correlation analysis to investigate the correlated trait pairs at the level of functional categories. In Europeans, we observed significant genetic correlation between AR and eosinophils in almost all functional categories with only exception being repressed regions. In East Asians, significant genetic correlations between AR and eosinophils were also detected at 17 of 24 functional categories, but AR and monocytes only significantly correlated at CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) regions. In addition, DHS (DNase Hypersensitive Site) regions, fetal DHS regions and H3K4me1 promotor regions showed significant correlation between pollinosis and leukocytes. No significant result was identified at any of these functional groups between pollinosis and neutrophils (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 4 ).

The shade of each square indicates a positive (blue) or negative (red) correlation, with the intensity of the color reflecting the magnitude of the correlation. For the genetically correlated traits, we further partitioned SNP heritability across six chromatin marks and nine cell types. The enrichment of SNP heritability was predominantly observed in blood and immune system-related cell types across all six chromatin marks. The most significant heritability enrichment was detected in eosinophils, both for AR in Europeans and for eosinophils in East Asians (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Although no significant enrichment was identified for AR in East Asians, the enrichment pattern for AR was similar between Europeans and East Asians, as these traits clustered together across each chromatin mark. Additionally, specific traits exhibited enrichment in particular cell types. For instance, significant heritability enrichment for monocytes was observed with the chromatin mark DNase in primary monocyte cells. We conducted a detailed genome-wide scan to identify specific genomic regions contributing to shared heritability between genetically correlated trait pairs. After correcting for multiple testing, 15 significantly correlated regions were identified between AR and eosinophils in Europeans (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table 5 ). Additionally, three regions within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region were found to be correlated between AR and eosinophils in East Asians (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table 5 ). No significant correlated regions were detected for other genetically correlated trait pairs.

Blue bars represent loci on odd-numbered chromosomes, and red bars represent loci on even-numbered chromosomes, both showing significant local genetic correlation after multiple testing adjustment ( p &lt; 0.05/1,703). Findings from the local genetic correlation analysis prompted us to further identify potential pleiotropic loci shared between AR and hematological traits. We conducted a multi-trait meta-analysis for each genetically correlated trait pair using two complementary methods: MTAG and CPASSOC. SNPs reaching genome-wide significance ( p &lt; 5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078) in both methods were conservatively prioritized. In the analysis of AR and eosinophils, 52 significant signals were identified in Europeans, including 22 novel loci and 30 loci previously reported in AR. Consistent with the local genetic correlation analysis, 18 of these loci were located within genetically correlated regions (Supplemental Table 5 and Fig. 2 ). Among the 22 novel loci, 14 had been previously reported in association with asthma (Supplemental Table 6 ). Of the remaining eight novel loci, the 9p24.1 locus ( JAK2 ) and 19q13.32 locus ( APOE ) have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively (Supplemental Table 6 ). In East Asians, we identified 12 pleiotropic loci for AR through the MTAG analysis between AR and eosinophils, five of which overlapped with loci detected in Europeans: 2q12.1 ( IL1RL1 ), 7p21.1 ( ABCB5 ), 10p14 ( GATA3 ), 16p13.13 ( CLEC16A ), and 16p12.1 ( IL4R ). Notably, we also discovered an East Asian-specific novel locus at 2q33.2. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of the top SNP, rs59789950, is 0.5 in East Asians but less than 0.001 in Europeans. Variant rs59789950 is located near the CD28 gene, which plays a critical role in T-cell proliferation and survival (Supplemental Table 7 ). In the analysis of AR and monocytes, only the 8q24.21 locus, a known locus in Europeans, was detected in East Asians (Supplemental Table 7 ). This locus also showed significance in the analysis of pollinosis and neutrophils, as well as pollinosis and leukocytes in East Asians. To explore the functional role of CD28 in AR, we analyzed gene expression data from a previous study (GSE141661) 44 . Our analysis revealed that CD28 was significantly downregulated in AR patients compared to healthy controls (Welch\u2019s t-test, P = 1.07 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076). We further categorized the samples into four groups: AR (patients with AR only), AR + (patients with AR and comorbid asthma or atopic dermatitis), Allergy (patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis), and Control (healthy controls), and compared CD28 expression levels among these groups. No significant differences were detected between AR and AR + (Welch\u2019s t-test, P = 0.55) or between Allergy and Control (Welch\u2019s t-test, P = 0.54). However, CD28 expression was significantly lower in the AR/AR + groups compared to the Allergy/Control groups (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 Differential analysis of CD28 expression levels.
