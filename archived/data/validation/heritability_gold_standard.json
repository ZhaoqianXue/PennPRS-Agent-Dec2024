      "title": "Shared genetic correlations between kidney diseases and sepsis.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have indicated a comorbidity between sepsis and kidney diseases. Individuals with specific mutations that predispose them to kidney conditions are also at an elevated risk for developing sepsis, and vice versa. This suggests a potential shared genetic etiology that has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: Summary statistics data on exposure and outcomes were obtained from genome-wide association meta-analysis studies. We utilized these data to assess genetic correlations, employing a pleiotropy analysis method under the composite null hypothesis to identify pleiotropic loci. After mapping the loci to their corresponding genes, we conducted pathway analysis using Generalized Gene-Set Analysis of GWAS Data (MAGMA). Additionally, we utilized MAGMA gene-test and eQTL information (whole blood tissue) for further determination of gene involvement. Further investigation involved stratified LD score regression, using diverse immune cell data, to study the enrichment of SNP heritability in kidney-related diseases and sepsis. Furthermore, we employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causality between kidney diseases and sepsis. RESULTS: In our genetic correlation analysis, we identified significant correlations among BUN, creatinine, UACR, serum urate, kidney stones, and sepsis. The PLACO analysis method identified 24 pleiotropic loci, pinpointing a total of 28 nearby genes. MAGMA gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a total of 50 pathways, and tissue-specific analysis indicated significant enrichment of five pairs of pleiotropic results in kidney tissue. MAGMA gene test and eQTL information (whole blood tissue) identified 33 and 76 pleiotropic genes, respectively. Notably, genes  CONCLUSIONS: This study lays the groundwork for shared etiological factors between kidney and sepsis. The confirmed pleiotropic loci, shared pathogenic genes, and enriched pathways and immune cells have enhanced our understanding of the multifaceted relationships among these diseases. This provides insights for early disease intervention and effective treatment, paving the way for further research in this field.",

      "abstract": "The role of gene-environment (GxE) interaction in disease and complex trait architectures is widely hypothesized but currently unknown. Here, we apply three statistical approaches to quantify and distinguish three different types of GxE interaction for a given trait and environmental (E) variable. First, we detect locus-specific GxE interaction by testing for genetic correlation (rg) < 1 across E bins. Second, we detect genome-wide effects of the E variable on genetic variance by leveraging polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to test for significant PRSxE in a regression of phenotypes on PRS, E, and PRSxE, together with differences in SNP heritability across E bins. Third, we detect genome-wide proportional amplification of genetic and environmental effects as a function of the E variable by testing for significant PRSxE with no differences in SNP heritability across E bins. We applied our framework to 33 UK Biobank traits (25 quantitative traits and 8 diseases; average n = 325,000) and 10 E variables spanning lifestyle, diet, and other environmental exposures. First, we identified 19 trait-E pairs with rg significantly <1 (false discovery rate < 5%); 28 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE and significant SNP heritability differences across E bins; and 15 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE but no SNP heritability differences across E bins. Across the three scenarios, eight of the trait-E pairs involved disease traits, whose interpretation is complicated by scale effects. Analyses using biological sex as the E variable produced additional significant findings in each of these scenarios. Overall, we infer a significant contribution of GxE and GxSex effects to complex trait variance.",

METHODS: Utilizing summary statistics data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a thorough investigation to evaluate the impact of common variations on the genome were undertook. This involved assessing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability across the entire genome, as well as within specific genomic regions. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, stringent quality control measures were applied to the GWAS summary statistics data.

By elucidating the SNP heritability landscape across different genomic regions, we contribute valuable insights into the genetic basis of NSCL/P.

      "abstract": "We present a systematic review of genome-wide research on psychotic experience and negative symptom (PENS) traits in the community. We integrate these new findings, most of which have emerged over the last four years, with more established behaviour genetic and epidemiological research. The review includes the first genome-wide association studies of PENS, including a recent meta-analysis, and the first SNP heritability estimates. Sample sizes of <10 000 participants mean that no genome-wide significant variants have yet been replicated. Importantly, however, in the most recent and well-powered studies, polygenic risk score prediction and linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression analyses show that all types of PENS share genetic influences with diagnosed schizophrenia and that negative symptom traits also share genetic influences with major depression. These genetic findings corroborate other evidence in supporting a link between PENS in the community and psychiatric conditions. Beyond the systematic review, we highlight recent work on gene-environment correlation, which appears to be a relevant process for psychotic experiences. Genes that influence risk factors such as tobacco use and stressful life events are likely to be harbouring 'hits' that also influence PENS. We argue for the acceptance of PENS within the mainstream, as heritable traits in the same vein as other sub-clinical psychopathology and personality styles such as neuroticism. While acknowledging some mixed findings, new evidence shows genetic overlap between PENS and psychiatric conditions. In sum, normal variations in adolescent and adult thinking styles, such as feeling paranoid, are heritable and show genetic associations with schizophrenia and major depression.",

      "abstract": "Brain imaging genomics has manifested considerable potential in illuminating the genetic determinants of human brain structure and function. This has propelled us to develop the GIANT (Genetically Informed brAiN aTlas) that accounts for genetic and neuroanatomical variations simultaneously. Integrating voxel-wise heritability and spatial proximity, GIANT clusters brain voxels into genetically informed regions, while retaining fundamental anatomical knowledge. Compared to conventional (non-genetics) brain atlases, GIANT exhibits smaller intra-region variations and larger inter-region variations in terms of voxel-wise heritability. As a result, GIANT yields increased regional SNP heritability, enhanced polygenicity, and its polygenic risk score explains more brain volumetric variation than traditional neuroanatomical brain atlases. We provide extensive validation to GIANT and demonstrate its neuroanatomical validity, confirming its generalizability across populations with diverse genetic ancestries and various brain conditions. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive genetic architecture of the GIANT regions, covering their functional annotation at the molecular levels, their associations with other complex traits/diseases, and the genetic and phenotypic correlations among GIANT-defined imaging endophenotypes. In summary, GIANT constitutes a brain atlas that captures the complexity of genetic and neuroanatomical heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the discovery power and applicability of imaging genomics investigations in biomedical science.",

To address this gap, here we investigated genetic differences between autistic individuals (nmax = 12,893) based on core and associated features of autism, co-occurring developmental disabilities and sex. We conducted a comprehensive factor analysis of core autism features in autistic individuals and identified six factors. Common genetic variants were associated with the core factors, but de novo variants were not. We found that higher autism polygenic scores (PGS) were associated with lower likelihood of co-occurring developmental disabilities in autistic individuals. Furthermore, in autistic individuals without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID), autism PGS are overinherited by autistic females compared to males. Finally, we observed higher SNP heritability for autistic males and for autistic individuals without ID. Deeper phenotypic characterization will be critical in determining how the complex underlying genetics shape cognition, behavior and co-occurring conditions in autism.",

This study sought evidence for genetic heterogeneity in MD. Using UK Biobank cohort, the authors defined 16 MD subtypes within eight comparison groups (vegetative symptoms, symptom severity, comorbid anxiety disorder, age at onset, recurrence, suicidality, impairment, and postpartum depression; N ~ 3000-47000). To compare genetic component of these subtypes, subtype-specific genome-wide association studies were performed to estimate SNP-heritability, and genetic correlations within subtype comparison and with other related disorders/traits. The findings indicated that MD subtypes were divergent in their SNP-heritability, and genetic correlations both within subtype comparisons and with other related disorders/traits. Three subtype comparisons (vegetative symptoms, age at onset, and impairment) showed significant differences in SNP-heritability; while genetic correlations within subtype comparisons ranged from 0.55 to 0.86, suggesting genetic profiles are only partially shared among MD subtypes. Furthermore, subtypes that are more clinically challenging, e.g., early-onset, recurrent, suicidal, more severely impaired, had stronger genetic correlations with other psychiatric disorders. MD with atypical-like features showed a positive genetic correlation (+0.40) with BMI while a negative correlation (-0.09) was found in those without atypical-like features. Novel genomic loci with subtype-specific effects were identified. These results provide the most comprehensive evidence to date for genetic heterogeneity within MD, and suggest that the phenotypic complexity of MD can be effectively reduced by studying the subtypes which share partially distinct etiologies.",

Importantly, the total psychiatric problem score also showed at least a moderate genetic correlation with intelligence, educational attainment, wellbeing, smoking, and body fat (rG > 0.29).

      "abstract": "For most complex traits, DNA-based heritability ('SNP heritability') is roughly half that of twin-based heritability. A previous report from the Twins Early Development Study suggested that this heritability gap is much greater for childhood behaviour problems than for other domains. If true, this finding is important because SNP heritability, not twin heritability, is the ceiling for genome-wide association studies. With twice the sample size as the previous report, we estimated SNP heritabilities (N up to 4653 unrelated individuals) and compared them with twin heritabilities from the same sample (N up to 4724 twin pairs) for diverse domains of childhood behaviour problems as rated by parents, teachers, and children themselves at ages 12 and 16. For 37 behaviour problem measures, the average twin heritability was 0.52, whereas the average SNP heritability was just 0.06. In contrast, results for cognitive and anthropometric traits were more typical (average twin and SNP heritabilities were 0.58 and 0.28, respectively). Future research should continue to investigate the reasons why SNP heritabilities for childhood behaviour problems are so low compared with twin estimates, and find ways to maximise SNP heritability for genome-wide association studies.",

      "abstract": "Prior to the development of genome-wide arrays and whole genome sequencing technologies, heritability estimation mainly relied on the study of related individuals. Over the past decade, various approaches have been developed to estimate SNP-based narrow-sense heritability ( h SNP 2 ${\\rm{h}}_{{\\rm{SNP}}}^2$ ) in unrelated individuals. These latter approaches use either individual-level genetic variations or summary results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recently, several studies compared these approaches using extensive simulations and empirical datasets. However, sparse information on hands-on training necessitates revisiting these approaches from the perspective of a stepwise guide for practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of the commonly used SNP-heritability estimation approaches utilizing genome-wide array, imputed or whole genome data from unrelated individuals, or summary results. We not only discuss these approaches based on their statistical concepts, utility, advantages, and limitations, but also provide step-by-step protocols to apply these approaches. For illustration purposes, we estimate h SNP 2 ${\\rm{h}}_{{\\rm{SNP}}}^2$ of height and BMI utilizing individual-level data from The Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC) and summary results from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT;) consortium.

      "abstract": "The role of gene-environment (GxE) interaction in disease and complex trait architectures is widely hypothesized, but currently unknown. Here, we apply three statistical approaches to quantify and distinguish three different types of GxE interaction for a given trait and E variable. First, we detect locus-specific GxE interaction by testing for genetic correlation rg<1 across E bins. Second, we detect genome-wide effects of the E variable on genetic variance by leveraging polygenic risk scores (PRS) to test for significant PRSxE in a regression of phenotypes on PRS, E, and PRSxE, together with differences in SNP-heritability across E bins. Third, we detect genome-wide proportional amplification of genetic and environmental effects as a function of the E variable by testing for significant PRSxE with no differences in SNP-heritability across E bins. Simulations show that these approaches achieve high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing these three GxE scenarios. We applied our framework to 33 UK Biobank traits (25 quantitative traits and 8 diseases; average N=325K) and 10 E variables spanning lifestyle, diet, and other environmental exposures. First, we identified 19 trait-E pairs with rg significantly < 1 (FDR<5%) (average rg=0.95); for example, white blood cell count had rg=0.95 (s.e. 0.01) between smokers and non-smokers. Second, we identified 28 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE and significant SNP-heritability differences across E bins; for example, BMI had a significant PRSxE for physical activity (P=4.6e-5) with 5% larger SNP-heritability in the largest versus smallest quintiles of physical activity (P=7e-4). Third, we identified 15 trait-E pairs with significant PRSxE with no SNP-heritability differences across E bins; for example, waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI had a significant PRSxE effect for time spent watching television (P=5e-3) with no SNP-heritability differences. Across the three scenarios, 8 of the trait-E pairs involved disease traits, whose interpretation is complicated by scale effects. Analyses using biological sex as the E variable produced additional significant findings in each of the three scenarios. Overall, we infer a significant contribution of GxE and GxSex effects to complex trait and disease variance.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Except APOE, Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated genes identified in recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had small effects and explained a small portion of heritability. Many AD-associated genes have even smaller effects thereby sub-threshold p-values in large-scale GWAS and remain to be identified. For some AD-associated genes, drug targeting them may have limited efficacies due to their small effect sizes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify AD-associated genes with sub-threshold p-values and prioritize drugs targeting AD-associated genes that have large efficacies. METHODS: We developed a gene-based polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify AD genes. It was calculated using SNPs located within genes and having the same directions of effects in different study cohorts to exclude cohort-specific findings and false positives. Gene co-expression modules and protein-protein interaction networks were used to identify AD-associated genes that interact with multiple other genes, as drugs targeting them have large efficacies via co-regulation or interactions. RESULTS: Gene-based PRS identified 389 genes with 164 of them not previously reported as AD-associated. These 389 genes explained 56.12% -97.46% SNP heritability; and they were enriched in brain tissues and 164 biological processes, most of which are related to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. We prioritized 688 drugs targeting 64 genes that were in the same co-expression modules and/or PPI networks. CONCLUSIONS: Gene-based PRS is a cost-effective way to identify AD-associated genes without substantially increasing the sample size. Co-expression modules and PPI networks can be used to identify drugs having large efficacies.",

Here we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of cocaine dependence using four datasets from the dbGaP repository (2085 cases and 4293 controls, all of them selected by their European ancestry). Although no genome-wide significant hits were found in the SNP-based analysis, the gene-based analysis identified HIST1H2BD as associated with cocaine-dependence (10% FDR). This gene is located in a region on chromosome 6 enriched in histone-related genes, previously associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, we performed LD Score regression analysis with comorbid conditions and found significant genetic correlations between cocaine dependence and SCZ, ADHD, major depressive disorder (MDD) and risk taking. We also found, through polygenic risk score analysis, that all tested phenotypes are significantly associated with cocaine dependence status: SCZ (R",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Strategies to dissect phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) have mainly relied on subphenotypes, such as age at onset (AAO) and recurrence/episodicity. Yet, evidence on whether these subphenotypes are familial or heritable is scarce. The aims of this study are to investigate the familiality of AAO and episode frequency in MDD and to assess the proportion of their variance explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP heritability). METHOD: For investigating familiality, we used 691 families with 2-5 full siblings with recurrent MDD from the DeNt study. We fitted (square root) AAO and episode count in a linear and a negative binomial mixed model, respectively, with family as random effect and adjusting for sex, age and center. The strength of familiality was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). For estimating SNP heritabilities, we used 3468 unrelated MDD cases from the RADIANT and GSK Munich studies. After similarly adjusting for covariates, derived residuals were used with the GREML method in GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis) software. RESULTS: Significant familial clustering was found for both AAO (ICC = 0.28) and episodicity (ICC = 0.07). We calculated from respective ICC estimates the maximal additive heritability of AAO (0.56) and episodicity (0.15). SNP heritability of AAO was 0.17 (p = 0.04); analysis was underpowered for calculating SNP heritability of episodicity. CONCLUSIONS: AAO and episodicity aggregate in families to a moderate and small degree, respectively. AAO is under stronger additive genetic control than episodicity. Larger samples are needed to calculate the SNP heritability of episodicity. The described statistical framework could be useful in future analyses.",

      "abstract": "The monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) is a useful biomarker for disease development, but little is known about the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence MLR variation. Here, we study the genetic architecture of MLR and determine the influence of demographic and lifestyle factors on MLR in data from a Dutch non-patient twin-family population. Data were obtained in 9,501 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register. We used regression analyses to determine the effects of age, sex, smoking, and body mass index (BMI) on MLR and its subcomponents. Data on twins, siblings and parents (N = 7,513) were analyzed by genetic structural equation modeling to establish heritability and genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a genotyped subsample (N = 5,892) and used to estimate heritability explained by SNPs. SNP and phenotype data were also analyzed in a genome-wide association study to identify the genes involved in MLR. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were performed to further explore the genetic findings. Results showed that age, sex, and age × sex interaction effects were present for MLR and its subcomponents. Variation in MLR was not related to BMI, but smoking was positively associated with MLR. Heritability was estimated at 40% for MLR, 58% for monocyte, and 58% for lymphocyte count. The Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a locus on ITGA4 that was associated with MLR and only marginally significantly associated with monocyte count. For monocyte count, additional genetic variants were identified on ITPR3, LPAP1, and IRF8. For lymphocyte count, GWAS provided no significant findings. Taking all measured SNPs together, their effects accounted for 13% of the heritability of MLR, while all known and identified genetic loci explained 1.3% of variation in MLR. eQTL analyses showed that these genetic variants were unlikely to be eQTLs. In conclusion, variation in MLR level in the general population is heritable and influenced by age, sex, and smoking. We identified gene variants in the ITGA4 gene associated with variation in MLR. The significant SNP-heritability indicates that more genetic variants are likely to be involved.",

We illustrate the utility of our method in estimating and partitioning variation in a trait explained by genotyped SNPs (SNP-heritability). Analyzing 22 traits with genotypes from 300,000 individuals across about 8 million common and low frequency SNPs, we observe that per-allele squared effect size increases with decreasing minor allele frequency (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) consistent with the action of negative selection.

An early age at onset of major depression (AAO-MD) has been associated with more severe illness, psychosis, and suicidality. However, not much is known about what contributes to individual variation in this important clinical characteristic. This study sought to investigate the genetic components underlying AAO-MD. To investigate the genetics of AAO-MD, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of AAO-MD based on self-reported age of symptoms onset and self-reported age at first diagnosis from the UK Biobank cohort (total N = 94,154). We examined the genetic relationship between AAO-MD and five other psychiatric disorders. Polygenic risk scores were derived to examine their association with five psychiatric outcomes and AAO-MD in independent sub-samples. We found a small but significant SNP-heritability (~6%) for the AAO-MD phenotype. No SNP or gene reached SNP or gene-level significance. We found evidence that AAO-MD has genetic overlap with MD risk ([Formula: see text] = -0.49). Similarly, we found shared genetic risks between AAO-MD and autism-spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anorexia nervosa ([Formula: see text] range: -0.3 to -0.5). Polygenic risk scores for AAO-MD were associated with MD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and AAO-MD was in turn associated with polygenic risk scores derived from these disorders. Overall, our results indicate that AAO-MD is heritable, and there is an inverse genetic relationship between AAO-MD and both major depression and other psychiatric disorders, meaning that SNPs associated with earlier age at onset tend to increase the risk for psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that the genetics of AAO-MD contribute to the shared genetic architecture observed between psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Residual energy intake (REI) on two successive diets (hay and maize based) and slaughter traits, including visceral organs, were phenotyped in 584 adult purebred Charolais cows. To investigate the relationships between these traits and their genetic determinism, we first estimated the genetic parameters, including correlations, using REML modeling under WOMBAT software. The animals were then genotyped on the BovineSNP50 SNPchip before being imputed to the 600K density and genome wide association study was performed with GCTA software. We found low heritability for REI (h2 = 0.12 in each of the diet phases). Although the phenotypic correlation between the two diet phases was moderate (0.36), the genetic correlation was high (0.83), indicating a common genetic determinism for feed efficiency regardless of the diet. Correlations between REI and slaughter traits were negative regarding muscle-related traits and positive for fat-related traits, indicating that efficient animals generally had a more muscular carcass. It was also seen that feed efficiency was genetically and phenotypically correlated with smaller organs when expressed as a proportion of their empty body weight. From the GWAS analysis, seven QTLs were found to be associated with a trait at the genome-wide level of significance and 18 others at the chromosome-wide level. One important QTL was detected in BTA 2, reflecting the essential effect of the myostatin gene on both carcass composition and relative organ weight. Three QTLs were detected for REI during the maize diet phase on BTA 13, 19, and 28, the latter being significant at the genome-wide level. The QTLs on BTA 19 mapped into the TANC2 gene and the QTLs on BTA 28 into the KIF1BP gene, which are both known to interact with the same protein (KIF1A). However, no obvious functional link between these genes and feed efficiency could be made. Among the other QTLs detected, one association on BTA 4 with liver proportion mapped to the candidate gene WASL, which has previously been shown to be differentially expressed in liver cells and linked to feed restriction or cancer development. No QTLs were found to be common between feed efficiency and any slaughter traits.",

In sex-disaggregated genome-wide association studies for COVID-19 hospitalization, genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) was crossed for variants in 3p21.31 and 21q22.11 loci only among males (P = 1.3 × 10-22 and P = 8.1 × 10-12, respectively), and for variants in 9q21.32 near TLE1 only among females (P = 4.4 × 10-8).

The meta-analysis of both phases with four European studies stratified by sex from the Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) confirmed the association of the 3p21.31 and 21q22.11 loci predominantly in males and replicated a recently reported variant in 11p13 (ELF5, P = 4.1 × 10-8). Six of the COVID-19 HGI discovered loci were replicated and an HGI-based genetic risk score predicted the severity strata in SCOURGE. We also found more SNP-heritability and larger heritability differences by age (<60 or ≥60 years) among males than among females. Parallel genome-wide screening of inbreeding depression in SCOURGE also showed an effect of homozygosity in COVID-19 hospitalization and severity and this effect was stronger among older males. In summary, new candidate genes for COVID-19 severity and evidence supporting genetic disparities among sexes are provided.",

Such genetic sensitivity to environmental contexts is called gene-environment interaction (G × E). While G × E has been robustly detected in twin and model organism studies for numerous phenotypes, there is a lingering perception that existing genome-wide G × E methods struggle to identify substantively significant and replicable interactions. We propose a novel method for examining G × E heritability using genetic marginal effects from genome-wide G × E analyses and Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for body mass index (BMI) using biological sex (binary) and age (continuous) as moderators. Using the same procedures for both binary and continuous moderators, we detect robust evidence for G × E. Our results are consistent with findings from twin G × E studies of BMI and are more sensitive to environmental moderation than other LDSC-based methods. We conclude that BMI heritability is substantially more sensitive to variation in sex and age than is currently appreciated. Extending this method to other phenotype-moderator combinations has the potential to reveal G × E across numerous outcomes and moderators.",

In the present study, we conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on lifetime self-harm ideation and self-harm behaviour (i.e. any lifetime self-harm act regardless of suicidal intent) using data from the UK Biobank (n > 156,000). We also perform genome wide gene-based tests and characterize the SNP heritability and genetic correlations between these traits. Finally, we test whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for self-harm ideation and self-harm behaviour predict suicide attempt, suicide thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm (NSSH) in an independent target sample of 8,703 Australian adults. Our GWAS results identified one genome-wide significant locus associated with each of the two phenotypes. SNP heritability (h",

      "abstract": "Deficits in effective executive function, including inhibitory control are associated with risk for a number of psychiatric disorders and significantly impact everyday functioning. These complex traits have been proposed to serve as endophenotypes, however, their genetic architecture is not yet well understood. To identify the common genetic variation associated with inhibitory control in the general population we performed the first trans-ancestry genome wide association study (GWAS) combining data across 8 sites and four ancestries (N = 14,877) using cognitive traits derived from the stop-signal task, namely - go reaction time (GoRT), go reaction time variability (GoRT SD) and stop signal reaction time (SSRT). Although we did not identify genome wide significant associations for any of the three traits, GoRT SD and SSRT demonstrated significant and similar SNP heritability of 8.2%, indicative of an influence of genetic factors. Power analyses demonstrated that the number of common causal variants contributing to the heritability of these phenotypes is relatively high and larger sample sizes are necessary to robustly identify associations. In Europeans, the polygenic risk for ADHD was significantly associated with GoRT SD and the polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with GoRT, while in East Asians polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with SSRT. These results support the potential of executive function measures as endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together these findings provide the first evidence indicating the influence of common genetic variation in the genetic architecture of inhibitory control quantified using objective behavioural traits derived from the stop-signal task.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Endometriosis affects 10% of women worldwide and is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth. Recent epidemiological and genetic studies indicate that endometriosis may influence gestational duration and the likelihood of preterm birth. This study aimed to estimate the direct genetic causal effects of endometriosis on gestational duration and preterm birth using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis, leveraging genetic data from recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs). DESIGN: A two-sample MR study. SETTING: Summary statistics from published GWASs on European ancestry populations for endometriosis and gestational duration. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Instrumental variables for endometriosis were derived from a meta-analysis comprising 60 674 endometriosis cases and 701 926 controls. METHODS: Genetic correlations and heritability estimates were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Two-sample MR with multiplicative random-effects inverse variance weighting assessed the primary objectives, supplemented by sensitivity analyses to validate MR assumptions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were gestational duration and preterm birth, sourced from the latest GWAS data. RESULTS: LD score regression revealed no genetic correlation between endometriosis and either gestational duration or preterm birth. MR analysis showed no causal association between endometriosis and maternal effects on offspring gestational duration (β = 0.40, 95% CI: -0.39 to 1.19, p = 0.32) or preterm birth (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.82-1.06, p = 0.36). Sensitivity analyses indicated pleiotropy but no violations of MR assumptions. Of the four loci overlapping between the gestational duration and endometriosis GWASs, three (EBF1, WNT4, and GDAP1) were identified as outliers using MR-Presso. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to observational studies, MR analyses found no direct causal link between endometriosis and gestational duration or preterm birth. Overlaps in genomic regions suggest that the relationship may be mediated through different biological pathways.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: P. falciparum malaria has been recognized as one of the prominent evolutionary selective forces of human genome that led to the emergence of multiple host protective alleles. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic bases of severe malaria susceptibility and resistance can potentially pave ways to the development of new therapeutics and vaccines. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recently been implemented in malaria endemic areas and identified a number of novel association genetic variants. However, there are several open questions around heritability, epistatic interactions, genetic correlations and associated molecular pathways among others. Here, we assess the progress and pitfalls of severe malaria susceptibility GWASs and discuss the biology of the novel variants. RESULTS: We obtained all severe malaria susceptibility GWASs published thus far and accessed GWAS dataset of Gambian populations from European Phenome Genome Archive (EGA) through the MalariaGen consortium standard data access protocols. We noticed that, while some of the well-known variants including HbS and ABO blood group were replicated across endemic populations, only few novel variants were convincingly identified and their biological functions remain to be understood. We estimated SNP-heritability of severe malaria at 20.1% in Gambian populations and showed how advanced statistical genetic analytic methods can potentially be implemented in malaria susceptibility studies to provide useful functional insights. CONCLUSIONS: The ultimate goal of malaria susceptibility study is to discover a novel causal biological pathway that provide protections against severe malaria; a fundamental step towards translational medicine such as development of vaccine and new therapeutics. Beyond singe locus analysis, the future direction of malaria susceptibility requires a paradigm shift from single -omics to multi-stage and multi-dimensional integrative functional studies that combines multiple data types from the human host, the parasite, the mosquitoes and the environment. The current biotechnological and statistical advances may eventually lead to the feasibility of systems biology studies and revolutionize malaria research.",

The full spectra of psychotic-like experience domains, both in terms of their severity and type (positive, cognitive, and negative), were assessed using self- and parent-ratings in three European community samples aged 15-19 years (Final N incl. siblings = 6,297-10,098). A mega-genome-wide association study (mega-GWAS) for each psychotic-like experience domain was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-heritability of each psychotic-like experience domain was estimated using genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood (GREML) and linkage disequilibrium- (LD-) score regression. Genetic overlap between specific psychotic-like experience domains and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression was assessed using polygenic risk score (PRS) and LD-score regression. GREML returned SNP-heritability estimates of 3-9% for psychotic-like experience trait domains, with higher estimates for less skewed traits (Anhedonia, Cognitive Disorganization) than for more skewed traits (Paranoia and Hallucinations, Parent-rated Negative Symptoms). Mega-GWAS analysis identified one genome-wide significant association for Anhedonia within IDO2 but which did not replicate in an independent sample. PRS analysis revealed that the schizophrenia PRS significantly predicted all adolescent psychotic-like experience trait domains (Paranoia and Hallucinations only in non-zero scorers). The major depression PRS significantly predicted Anhedonia and Parent-rated Negative Symptoms in adolescence. Psychotic-like experiences during adolescence in the community show additive genetic effects and partly share genetic influences with clinically-recognized psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia and major depression.",

LDpred2-auto can infer the two parameters from the LDpred model, the SNP heritability h2 and polygenicity p, so that it does not require an additional validation dataset to choose best-performing parameters. The main aim of this paper is to properly validate the use of LDpred2-auto for inferring multiple genetic parameters. Here, we present a new version of LDpred2-auto that adds an optional third parameter α to its model, for modeling negative selection. We then validate the inference of these three parameters (or two, when using the previous model). We also show that LDpred2-auto provides per-variant probabilities of being causal that are well calibrated and can therefore be used for fine-mapping purposes. We also introduce a formula to infer the out-of-sample predictive performance r2 of the resulting PGS directly from the Gibbs sampler of LDpred2-auto. Finally, we extend the set of HapMap3 variants recommended to use with LDpred2 with 37% more variants to improve the coverage of this set, and we show that this new set of variants captures 12% more heritability and provides 6% more predictive performance, on average, in UK Biobank analyses.",

Linear mixed model (LMM) has been widely used for SNP heritability estimation, where variance component parameters are commonly estimated by using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. REML is an iterative optimization algorithm, which is computationally intensive when applied to large-scale datasets (e.g. UK Biobank). To facilitate the heritability analysis of large-scale genetic datasets, we develop a fast approach, minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimator (MINQUE) with batch training, to estimate variance components from LMM (LMM.MNQ.BCH). In LMM.MNQ.BCH, the parameters are estimated by MINQUE, which has a closed-form solution for fast computation and has no convergence issue. Batch training has also been adopted in LMM.MNQ.BCH to accelerate the computation for large-scale genetic datasets. Through simulations and real data analysis, we demonstrate that LMM.MNQ.BCH is much faster than two existing approaches, GCTA and BOLT-REML.",

It leverages extensive sample data derived from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to uncover genetic correlations. METHODS: Employing Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) and S-LDSC, this study investigates genetic connections between 25OHD and SCZ. It examines Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability in specific tissues and incorporates diverse immune cell datasets for genetic enrichment analysis. Local genetic correlations were analyzed using HESS software, and pleiotropy analysis identified shared genetic loci in brain tissues. Hyprcoloc analysis was used to explore shared genetic factors between 25OHD, immune cells, and SCZ, complemented by a bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) to probe potential causal links. RESULTS: We identified a significant negative genetic correlation between 25OHD levels and SCZ. PLACO analysis revealed 35 pleiotropic loci with strong enrichment in brain regions, particularly the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Eight loci (1p34.2, 2p23.3, 3p21.1, 5q31.2, 12q23.2, 14q32.33, 16p13.3, and 16q24.3) exhibited strong colocalization, highlighting potential drug targets. Gene and tissue enrichment analyses emphasized neurological and immune-related mechanisms, including hyaluronan metabolism. Bidirectional MR analysis supported a causal effect of SCZ on 25OHD levels. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies NEK4 as a potential therapeutic target and highlights the involvement of hyaluronan metabolism in the genetic association between 25OHD and SCZ.

Stratified LDSC characterized genetic overlap across functional categories. Cross-trait meta-analyses identified shared risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by colocalization analysis using Coloc. Bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) assessed causality, while tissue-level SNP heritability enrichment for BD and BMI was evaluated using LDSC-specific expressed genes and Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation. RESULTS: We found a genetic correlation between BD and BMI, especially in localized genomic regions. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 46 significant SNPs shared between BD and BMI, including three novel shared risk SNPs. Colocalization analysis verified two novel SNPs with shared causal variants linked to ITIH1 and TM6SF2 genes. MR analysis demonstrated a causal effect of BD on BMI, but not the reverse.

      "abstract": "Twin studies have shown that emotional problems (anxiety and depression) in childhood and adolescence are moderately heritable (~20-50%). In contrast, DNA-based 'SNP heritability' estimates are generally <15% and non-significant. One notable feature of emotional problems is that they can be somewhat transient, but the moderate stability seen across time and across raters is predominantly influenced by stable genetic influences. This suggests that by capturing what is in common across time and across raters, we might be more likely to tap into any underlying genetic vulnerability. We therefore hypothesised that a phenotype capturing the pervasive stability of emotional problems would show higher heritability. We fitted single-factor latent trait models using 12 emotional problems measures across ages 7, 12 and 16, rated by parents, teachers and children themselves in the Twins Early Development Study sample. Twin and SNP heritability estimates for stable emotional problems (N = 6110 pairs and 6110 unrelated individuals, respectively) were compared to those for individual measures. Twin heritability increased from 45% on average for individual measures to 76% (se = 0.023) by focusing on stable trait variance. SNP heritability rose from 5% on average (n.s.) to 14% (se = 0.049; p = 0.002). Heritability was also higher for stable within-rater composites. Polygenic scores for both adult anxiety and depression significantly explained variance in stable emotional problems (0.4%; p = 0.0001). The variance explained was more than in most individual measures. Stable emotional problems also showed significant genetic correlation with adult depression and anxiety (average = 52%). These results demonstrate the value of examining stable emotional problems in gene-finding and prediction studies.",

Less attention has been paid to the inherent variability in these estimates. One approach for quantifying variability in estimates of heritability is a frequentist approach, in which heritability is estimated using maximum likelihood and its variance is quantified through an asymptotic normal approximation. An alternative approach is to quantify the uncertainty in heritability through its Bayesian posterior distribution. In this paper, we develop the latter approach, make it computationally efficient and compare it to the frequentist approach. We show theoretically that, for a sufficiently large sample size and intermediate values of heritability, the two approaches provide similar results. Using the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, we show empirically that the two approaches can give different results and that the variance/uncertainty can remain large.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease (AD) characterized by chronic, relapsing intestinal inflammation. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement and overactivation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The extra intestinal manifestations (EIMs) that commonly occur in IBD include many of the organ sites that are affected by SLE. ADs are often comorbid with one another and may have shared underlying genetic features and architectures contributing to their pathogenesis and disease course. We performed both epidemiological and post-genome wide association study (GWAS) analyses to investigate the shared genetic features between IBD and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Specifically, we performed epidemiological association analysis in the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) and genome-wide/local genetic correlation analysis and cell-type specific SNP heritability enrichment analysis using previously published summary level data. A significant epidemiologic association exists between IBD and SLE with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.94 (95% CI: 2.45-3.53; P < 0.001) in a multivariable model accounting for confounders in the AoURP data. Genome-wide genetic correlation analysis in previously published summary level data demonstrated a significant genetic correlation between IBD, CD, and UC with SLE, and local genetic correlation analysis demonstrated several positive and significant correlations in local genomic regions harboring disease variants in genes common to both SLE and IBD etiology, including variants in ELF1, CD226, JAZF1, WDFY4, and JAK2. Cell-type SNP heritability enrichment analysis identified both overlapping and distinct functional categories contributing to SNP heritability across IBD phenotypes. Notably, IBD-related phenotypes demonstrated significant enrichment in T-lymphocyte functional groups while SLE signal appeared in distinct categories, such as B-lymphocytes (along with CD). Gene-level collapsing analysis of rare variants in the United Kingdom BioBank (UKBB) identified overlapping nominally-significant genes between SLE and IBD, CD, and UC. By leveraging several post-GWAS methods, the present study identifies shared genetic features between IBD and SLE, highlighting similarities and differences in the genetic features that contribute to the pathogenesis of each disease.",

However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. METHODS: The study population consisted of IBD and Ps genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Genetic correlations were first evaluated. Then, the overall evaluation employed LD score regression (LDSC), while the local assessment utilized heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS). Causality assessment was conducted through two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR), and genetic overlap analysis utilized the conditional false discovery rate/conjunctional FDR (cond/conjFDR) method. Finally, LDSC applied to specifically expressed genes (LDSC-SEG) was performed at the tissue level. For IBD and Ps-specific expressed genes, genetic correlation, causality, shared genetics, and trait-specific associated tissues were methodically examined. RESULTS: At the genomic level, both overall and local genetic correlations were found between IBD and Ps. MR analysis indicated a positive causal relationship between Ps and IBD. The conjFDR analysis with a threshold of < 0.01 identified 43 loci shared between IBD and Ps. Subsequent investigations into disease-associated tissues indicated a close association of IBD and Ps with whole blood, lung, spleen, and EBV-transformed lymphocytes.

      "abstract": "SNP heritability h s n p 2 is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genotyped SNPs and is believed to be a lower bound of heritability h 2 , being equal to it if all causal variants are genotyped. Despite the simple intuition behind h s n p 2 , its interpretation and equivalence to h 2 is unclear, particularly in the presence of admixture and assortative mating. Here we use analytical theory and simulations to describe the behavior of h 2 and three widely used random-effect estimators of h s n p 2 - Genome-wide restricted maximum likelihood (GREML), Haseman-Elston (HE) regression, and LD score regression (LDSC) - in admixed populations. We show that h s n p 2 estimates can be biased in admixed populations, even if all causal variants are genotyped and in the absence of confounding due to shared environment. This is largely because admixture generates directional LD, which contributes to the genetic variance, and therefore to heritability. Random-effect estimators of h s n p 2 , because they assume that SNP effects are independent, do not capture the contribution, which can be positive or negative depending on the genetic architecture, leading to under- or over-estimates of h s n p 2 relative to h 2 . For the same reason, estimates of local ancestry heritability h ^ &#947; 2 are also biased in the presence of directional LD. We describe this bias in h ^ s n p 2 and h ^ &#947; 2 as a function of admixture history and the genetic architecture of the trait, clarifying their interpretation and implication for genome-wide association studies and polygenic prediction in admixed populations.",

      "abstract": "Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions, often resulting in cluttered living spaces, distress, and impairment. Its etiology is largely unknown, but twin studies suggest that it is moderately heritable. In this study, we pooled phenotypic and genomic data from seven international cohorts (N = 27,537 individuals) and conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported hoarding symptoms (HS). We followed up the results with gene-based and gene-set analyses, as well as leave-one-out HS polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses. To examine a possible genetic association between hoarding symptoms and other phenotypes we conducted cross-trait PRS analyses. Though we did not report any genome-wide significant SNPs, we report heritability estimates for the twin-cohorts between 26-48%, and a SNP-heritability of 11% for an unrelated sub-cohort. Cross-trait PRS analyses showed that the genetic risk for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder were significantly associated with hoarding symptoms. We also found suggestive evidence for an association with educational attainment. There were no significant associations with other phenotypes previously linked to HD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. To conclude, we found that HS are heritable, confirming and extending previous twin studies but we had limited power to detect any genome-wide significant loci. Much larger samples will be needed to further extend these findings and reach a \"gene discovery zone\". To move the field forward, future research should not only include genetic analyses of quantitative hoarding traits in larger samples, but also in samples of individuals meeting strict diagnostic criteria for HD, and more ethnically diverse samples.",

METHODS: The Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) for heritability and genetic correlations, Polygenic Likelihood Ratio under a Composite Null Hypothesis (PLACO) method for pleiotropic loci and locus, and Functional maps and annotations from genome-wide association studies (FUMA) for function analysis of multi-effect loci, multi-marker analysis of genoMic annotation (MAGMA) for gene tissue specificity, Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses for causal relationships between AD and five stroke subtypes were performed through Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability enrichments and causal associations were analyzed using comprehensive GWAS data. RESULTS: Manhattan plots revealed pleiotropic SNPs mainly on chromosomes 11 and 19, with additional loci on chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 for specific subgroups. Key genes like DEDD, UFC1, USP21, affecting both AD and stroke subtypes, were enriched in brain tissues, highlighting shared mechanisms. Stratified LD score regression showed overlaps in brain regions such as substantia nigra and spinal cord. MR analysis indicated AD as a risk factor for LAS and AS but protective for cerebral embolism stroke (CES), supported by consistent causal effect estimates without publication bias. This study reveals that AD shares genetic factors with multiple stroke subtypes, notably in brain tissues, impacting their etiology and potential treatments. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study revealed that AD shares genetic factors with multiple stroke subtypes, notably in brain tissues.

Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of genetic architecture, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by allele frequency and/or LD. We show analytically and through extensive simulations starting from real genotypes (UK Biobank, N = 337 K) that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator is robust across a wide range of architectures. We provide estimates of SNP-heritability for 22 complex traits in the UK Biobank and show that, consistent with our results in simulations, existing biobank-scale methods yield estimates up to 30% different from our theoretically-justified approach.",

For example, predicted heights correlate ∼0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few centimeters of the prediction. The proportion of variance explained for height is comparable to the estimated common SNP heritability from genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for SNPs. Thus, our results close the gap between prediction R-squared and common SNP heritability. The ∼20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common variants.

SUM-RHE employs Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics and statistics obtained on a reference population, which can be efficiently estimated and readily shared for public use.

Here, we estimate the polygenic SNP heritability for 1104 gut microbiota taxa, only 96 (8.7%) showed significant polygenic heritability. We identify 14 distinct gut microbiota taxa with pleiotropic effects on estimated heel bone mineral density (eBMD), 11 of them are found to have a causal association with eBMD. Following sensitivity and validation analyses, we find that the gut microbiota taxa family Bifidobacteriaceae; genus Bifidobacterium and species Bifidobacterium adolescentis exert causal effects leading to decreased eBMD. Mediation analyses indicate that the impact of these taxa on eBMD may be driven by their influence on circulating stearidonate (18:4n-3) levels via n-3 pathway, with mediating proportion from 77.53% to 87.24%. In conclusion, the genetically informed negative association between bifidobacterial taxa and bone mass may reflect the host-microbe interactions at LCT/MCM6 locus and represent an adaptive microbial response to lactose intolerance, thus, it could potentially be mitigated through supplementation with bifidobacterial probiotics and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

OBJECTIVE: To calculate the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of pigmentary glaucoma and identify genetic associations with the disease. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association study included affected individuals from Germany and control participants from the United Kingdom. Genome-wide information was obtained for patients with pigmentary glaucoma and control participants free of glaucoma by using the Illumina Human Omni Express Exome 8v1-2 chip and genomic imputation. The SNP heritability of pigmentary glaucoma was estimated through a restricted maximum likelihood analysis. Associations between the genetic variants and pigmentary glaucoma obtained from age, sex, and principal component-adjusted logistic regression models were compared with those of SNPs previously associated with other eye phenotypes using Pearson product-moment correlations. Data were collected from November 2008 to January 2018, and analysis was completed between April 2018 and August 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An estimate of SNP-explained heritability for pigmentary glaucoma; correlations of effect sizes between pigmentary glaucoma and iris pigmentation and myopia; and correlations of effect sizes between pigmentary glaucoma and other eye phenotypes. RESULTS: A total of 227 affected individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [13.3] years) and 291 control participants (mean [SD] age, 80.2 [4.9] years) were included; all were of European ancestry. The SNP heritability of pigmentary glaucoma was 0.45 (SE, 0.22; P = 6.15 × 10-10). Twelve SNPs previously reported with genome-wide significant associations with eye pigmentation were associated with pigmentary glaucoma's SNP heritability (4.9% SNP heritability; 0.022; P = 6.0 × 10-4). Pigmentary glaucoma SNP effect sizes were correlated moderately for myopia (r, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.14-0.63]; P = 4.3 × 10-3) and more strongly with those for iris pigmentation (r = -0.69 [95% CI, -0.91 to -0.20]; P = .01), although this was nonsignificant per a strict adjusted significance threshold (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings support the conclusion that pigmentary glaucoma may have a genetic basis and be highly heritable. Variants associated with lighter eye color and myopia appear to be associated with increased risk of pigmentary glaucoma, but no shared genetic basis with primary open-angle glaucoma (or its quantitative endophenotype of cup-disc ratio) was observed.",

      "abstract": "A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a complex, multi-dimensional morphological trait, such as the human face, typically relies on predefined and simplified phenotypic measurements, such as inter-landmark distances and angles. These measures are predominantly designed by human experts based on perceived biological or clinical knowledge. To avoid use handcrafted phenotypes (i.e., a priori expert-identified phenotypes), alternative automatically extracted phenotypic descriptors, such as features derived from dimension reduction techniques (e.g., principal component analysis), are employed. While the features generated by such computational algorithms capture the geometric variations of the biological shape, they are not necessarily genetically relevant. Therefore, genetically informed data-driven phenotyping is desirable. Here, we propose an approach where phenotyping is done through a data-driven optimization of trait heritability, defined as the degree of variation in a phenotypic trait in a population that is due to genetic variation. The resulting phenotyping process consists of two steps: 1) constructing a feature space that models shape variations using dimension reduction techniques, and 2) searching for directions in the feature space exhibiting high trait heritability using a genetic search algorithm (i.e., heuristic inspired by natural selection). We show that the phenotypes resulting from the proposed trait heritability-optimized training differ from those of principal components in the following aspects: 1) higher trait heritability, 2) higher SNP heritability, and 3) identification of the same number of independent genetic loci with a smaller number of effective traits. Our results demonstrate that data-driven trait heritability-based optimization enables the automatic extraction of genetically relevant phenotypes, as shown by their increased power in genome-wide association scans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heritability and genetic correlation can be estimated from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using various methods. We recently developed multivariate genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum likelihood (MGREML) for statistically and computationally efficient estimation of SNP-based heritability ([Formula: see text]) and genetic correlation ([Formula: see text]) across many traits in large datasets. Here, we extend MGREML by allowing it to fit and perform tests on user-specified factor models, while preserving the low computational complexity. RESULTS: Using simulations, we show that MGREML yields consistent estimates and valid inferences for such factor models at low computational cost (e.g., for data on 50 traits and 20,000 individuals, a saturated model involving 50 [Formula: see text]'s, 1225 [Formula: see text]'s, and 50 fixed effects is estimated and compared to a restricted model in less than one hour on a single notebook with two 2.7 GHz cores and 16 GB of RAM). Using repeated measures of height and body mass index from the US Health and Retirement Study, we illustrate the ability of MGREML to estimate a factor model and test whether it fits the data better than a nested model. The MGREML tool, the simulation code, and an extensive tutorial are freely available at https://github.com/devlaming/mgreml/ . CONCLUSION: MGREML can now be used to estimate multivariate factor structures and perform inferences on such factor models at low computational cost. This new feature enables simple structural equation modeling using MGREML, allowing researchers to specify, estimate, and compare genetic factor models of their choosing using SNP data.",

However, the role of genetic factors in their comorbidity remains unknown. METHODS: Using large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we employed linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to identify the breast cancer subtype most genetically correlated with BT. We then constructed the shared genetic architecture between BT and this subtype by: (1) applied Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics for local genetic correlations and stratified-LDSC for partitioned heritability; (2) performed a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis to find novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and validated through colocalization; (3) conducted both cross-tissue and single-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and validated the candidate genes through Mendelian randomization (MR); (4) investigated SNP-heritability enrichment at the gene set, tissue, and cell levels using Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation. RESULTS: Luminal A breast cancer (Luminal ABC) was selected as it is a common subtype of breast cancer and demonstrates a superior genetic correlation with BT. We identified strong local correlations in 132 distinct genomic regions and confirmed shared SNPs including rs1432679 and rs7175852. TWAS highlighted two pleiotropic genes, MICALL1 and TRIOBP, with TRIOBP validated by MR. We also found six shared pathways and luminal cells in mammary gland pregnancy shared between BT and Luminal ABC. For tissue-specific enrichment, BT was mainly found in the liver and adrenal gland, whereas Luminal ABC was found in the minor salivary gland.

      "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are valuable for understanding human biology, but associated loci typically contain multiple associated variants and genes. Thus, algorithms that prioritize likely causal genes and variants for a given phenotype can provide biological interpretations of association data. However, a critical, currently missing capability is to objectively compare performance of such algorithms. Typical comparisons rely on \"gold standard\" genes harboring causal coding variants, but such gold standards may be biased and incomplete. To address this issue, we developed Benchmarker, an unbiased, data-driven benchmarking method that compares performance of similarity-based prioritization strategies to each other (and to random chance) by leave-one-chromosome-out cross-validation with stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We first applied Benchmarker to 20 well-powered GWASs and compared gene prioritization based on strategies employing three different data sources, including annotated gene sets and gene expression; genes prioritized based on gene sets had higher per-SNP heritability than those prioritized based on gene expression. Additionally, in a direct comparison of three methods, DEPICT and MAGMA outperformed NetWAS. We also evaluated combinations of methods; our results indicated that combining data sources and algorithms can help prioritize higher-quality genes for follow-up. Benchmarker provides an unbiased approach to evaluate any similarity-based method that provides genome-wide prioritization of genes, variants, or gene sets and can determine the best such method for any particular GWAS. Our method addresses an important unmet need for rigorous tool assessment and can assist in mapping genetic associations to causal function.",

However, the role of genetic factors in their comorbidity remains largely unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the shared genetic architecture underlying obesity and MS. METHODS: By leveraging data from genome-wide association studies, we investigated the genetic correlation of body mass index (BMI) and MS by linkage disequilibrium score regression and genetic covariance analyser. The casualty was identified by bidirectional Mendelian randomisation. Linkage disequilibrium score regression in specifically expressed genes and multimarker analysis of GenoMic annotation was utilised to explore single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) enrichment at the tissue and cell-type levels. Shared risk SNPs were derived using cross-trait meta-analyses and Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics. We explored the potential functional genes using summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). The expression profiles of the risk gene in tissues were further examined. FINDINGS: We found a significantly positive genetic correlation between BMI and MS, and the causal association of BMI with MS was supported (β = 0.22, P = 8.03E-05). Cross-trait analysis yielded 39 shared risk SNPs, and the risk gene GGNBP2 was consistently identified in SMR. We observed tissue-specific level SNP heritability enrichment for BMI mainly in brain tissues for MS in immune-related tissues, and cell-type-specific level SNP heritability enrichment in 12 different immune cell types in brain, spleen, lung, and whole blood. The expressions of GGNBP2 were significantly altered in the tissues of patients with obesity or MS compared to those of control subjects. INTERPRETATION: Our study indicates the genetic correlation and shared risk genes between obesity and MS.

Responses ranged from cue-directed \"sign-tracking\" behavior to food-cup directed \"goal-tracking\" behavior (12 measures, SNP heritability: 0.051-0.215). Next, rats performed novel operant responses for unrewarded presentations of the cue using the conditioned reinforcement procedure. GWAS identified 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 11 of the 12 traits across both tasks. Interval sizes of these QTLs varied widely. Seven traits shared a QTL on chromosome 1 that contained a few genes (e.g., Tenm4, Mir708) that have been associated with substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders in humans. Other candidate genes (e.g., Wnt11, Pak1) in this region had coding variants and expression-QTLs in mesocorticolimbic regions of the brain.

We estimate ${\\boldsymbol{h}}_{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals to date. Most traits have high concordance of ${\\boldsymbol{h}}_{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of ${\\boldsymbol{h}}_{\\boldsymbol{g}}^{\\mathbf{2}}$. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for BMI, the per-standardized-annotation effect size $ \\tau $* is 0.16 ± 0.04, 0.28 ± 0.11 and 0.18 ± 0.03 in the Latino-, African American- and European-ancestry populations, respectively. Our approach is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from admixed populations.",

      "abstract": "In the nineteenth century, the prevalence of myopia began to rise, and Cohn stressed the role of education. Later, based on twin studies, Sorsby argued that refraction was almost totally genetically determined. This became the dominant view. However, rapid increases in the prevalence of myopia were then reported, especially in East and Southeast Asia, where the prevalence of myopia in children completing secondary school is now 80-90 per cent, with around 20 per cent highly myopic, and at risk of ocular pathology. It is not possible to explain these rapid changes genetically, since gene pools cannot change that fast. Nevertheless, there are at least 200 genetic forms of myopia, but these account for myopia in only a low percentage of the population. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 150 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with myopia, but they account for < 10 per cent of the variation in refraction. In contrast, twin studies have given consistently high heritability estimates for myopia. The high twin study heritability may be explained by the limited environmental variation within twin pairs, combined with basic assumptions made in twin studies. The SNP-heritability approach suggests that 25-35 per cent of the variation may be accounted for by hundreds or even thousands of SNPs. The apparent conflicts in the literature can be explained by the aetiological heterogeneity of myopia, and the fact that estimates of heritability are population-specific. It has been proposed that environmental variation is more relevant to variations between populations; however, the current differences between populations are due to changes within populations, driven by educational pressures, and limited time spent outdoors. Ethnic differences in myopia and the effects of parental myopia now seem more likely to be explained by environmental influences. Genetic studies have not yet defined molecular pathways and preventive interventions, and the predictive power of current genetic data is limited.",

The co-occurrence of IBD and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) has been increasingly observed, but the underlying relationship between these conditions remains unclear. METHODS: Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we investigated the causal effects between PBC and IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We also analyzed the shared genetic architecture between IBD and PBC using data from GWAS, bulk-tissue RNA sequencing, and single cell RNA sequencing, and explored potential functional genes. RESULT: There was a strong positive genetic correlation between PBC and IBD (linkage disequilibrium score regression:  CONCLUSIONS: This study detected shared genetic architecture between IBD and PBC and demonstrated a stable causal relationship of genetically predicted PBC on the risk of IBD. These findings shed light on the biological basis of comorbidity between IBD and PBC, and have important implications for intervention and treatment targets of these two diseases simultaneously. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: The discovery of novel shared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional genes provides insights into the common targets between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), serving as a basis for new drug development and contributing to the study of disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the established significant causality and genetic correlation underscore the importance of clinical intervention in preventing the comorbidity of IBD and PBC. The enrichment of SNP heritability in specific tissues and cell types reveals the role of immune factors in the potential disease mechanisms shared between IBD and PBC. This stimulates further research on potential interventions and could lead to the development of new targets for immune-based therapies.",

Recent technological and statistical advances have enabled the estimation of additive heritability attributable to common genetic variants (SNP heritability) across a broad phenotypic spectrum. Here, we present a computationally and memory efficient heritability estimation method that can handle large sample sizes, and report the SNP heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the interim data release (152,736 subjects) of the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes. We demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to a broad array of quantitative traits and human diseases in the UK population, and identify phenotypes whose heritability is moderated by age (e.g., a majority of physical measures including height and body mass index), sex (e.g., blood pressure related traits) and socioeconomic status (education).

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide and represents a significant socioeconomic and public health burden. Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype 'chronic pain grade', have been shown previously to be complex heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individual's overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the UK general population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP in ~380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits, including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. Overall, our findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component with implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain. These discoveries may also inform the future development of novel treatment approaches.",

It is not known whether this vulnerability is specific to anatomically-modern humans or shared with other hominids. The contribution of introgressed Neanderthal DNA to neurodegenerative disorders remains uncertain. It is also unclear how common variants associated with neurodegenerative disease risk are maintained by natural selection in the population despite their deleterious effects. In this study, we aimed to quantify the genome-wide contribution of Neanderthal introgression and positive selection to the heritability of complex neurodegenerative disorders to address these questions. We used stratified-linkage disequilibrium score regression to investigate the relationship between five SNP-based signatures of natural selection, reflecting different timepoints of evolution, and genome-wide associated variants of the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We found no evidence for enrichment of positively-selected SNPs in the heritability of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that common deleterious disease variants are unlikely to be maintained by positive selection. There was no enrichment of Neanderthal introgression in the SNP-heritability of these disorders, suggesting that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to disease risk. These findings provide insight into the origins of neurodegenerative disorders within the evolution of Homo sapiens and addresses a long-standing debate, showing that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to common genetic risk of neurodegeneration in anatomically-modern humans.",

To investigate this, we used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate a matrix of genetic correlations (rgs) for antisocial behavior (ASB), COVID-19, and various health and behavioral traits. After false-discovery rate correction, ASB was genetically correlated with COVID-19 (rg = 0.51; P = 1.54E-02) and 19 other traits. ASB and COVID-19 were both positively genetically correlated with having a noisy workplace, doing heavy manual labor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and genitourinary diseases. ASB and COVID-19 were both inversely genetically correlated with average income, education years, healthspan, verbal reasoning, lifespan, cheese intake, and being breastfed as a baby. But keep in mind that rgs are not necessarily causal. And, if causal, their prevailing directions of effect (which causes which) are indiscernible from rgs alone. Moreover, the SNP-heritability ([Formula: see text]) estimates for two measures of COVID-19 were very small, restricting the overlap of genetic variance in absolute terms between ASB and COVID-19. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that those with antisocial tendencies possibly have a higher risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than those without antisocial tendencies. This may have been especially true early in the pandemic before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were available and before the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.",

Here, we introduce methods to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by a given assignment of SNPs to a single gene (\"gene-level heritability\"). We partition gene-level heritability by minor allele frequency (MAF) to find genes whose gene-level heritability is explained exclusively by \"low-frequency/rare\" variants (0.5% ≤ MAF < 1%). Applying our method to ∼16K protein-coding genes and 25 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (N = 290K \"White British\"), we find that, on average across traits, ∼2.5% of nonzero-heritability genes have a rare-variant component and only ∼0.8% (327 gene-trait pairs) have heritability exclusively from rare variants. Of these 327 gene-trait pairs, 114 (35%) were not detected by existing gene-level association testing methods. The additional genes we identify are significantly enriched for known disease genes, and we find several examples of genes that have been previously implicated in phenotypically related Mendelian disorders. Notably, the rare-variant component of gene-level heritability exhibits trends different from those of common-variant gene-level heritability. For example, while total gene-level heritability increases with gene length, the rare-variant component is significantly larger among shorter genes; the cumulative distributions of gene-level heritability also vary across traits and reveal differences in the relative contributions of rare/common variants to overall gene-level polygenicity. While nonzero gene-level heritability does not imply causality, if interpreted in the correct context, gene-level heritability can reveal useful insights into complex-trait genetic architecture.",

Overall, the number of new genome-wide significant findings after data-integration increases as a trait SNP-heritability estimate increases. However, there is a trade-off between new findings and loss of baseline GWAS findings, resulting in similar total numbers of significant findings between using GWAS alone and integrating GWAS with functional scores, across all 1132 traits analyzed and all three data-integration methods considered. Our findings suggest that, even with the current biobank-level sample size, more informative functional scores and/or new data-integration methods are needed to further improve the power of GWAS of common variants.

We tested three hypotheses: (1) DNA variation in, or around, the 'model organism geneset' will contribute to the heritability to human tobacco consumption, (2) that the model organism genes will be enriched for genes associated with human tobacco consumption, and (3) that a polygenic score based off our model organism geneset will predict tobacco consumption in the AddHealth sample (N = 1667; all European Ancestry). Our results suggested that: (1) model organism genes accounted for ~5-36% of the observed SNP-heritability in human tobacco consumption (enrichment: 1.60-31.45), (2) model organism genes, but not negative control genes, were enriched for the gene-based associations (MAGMA, H-MAGMA, SMultiXcan) for human cigarettes per day, and (3) polygenic scores based on our model organism geneset predicted cigarettes per day in an independent sample.

In children, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded the first suggestive results when aiming to identify genetic variants that explain heritability, but the proportion of genetic variance that can be attributed to common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remains to be determined, as only a few studies have estimated SNP heritability, with diverging results. METHOD: Genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) as implemented in the software Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate SNP heritability (SNP h(2)) for multiple phenotypes within 4 broad domains of children's behavioral problems (attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms, internalizing, externalizing, and pervasive developmental problems) and cognitive function. We combined phenotype and genotype data from 2 independent, population-based Dutch cohorts, yielding a total number of 1,495 to 3,175 of 3-, 7-, and 9-year-old children. RESULTS: Significant SNP heritability estimates were found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms (SNP h(2) = 0.37-0.71), externalizing problems (SNP h(2) = 0.44), and total problems (SNP h(2) = 0.18), rated by mother or teacher. Sensitivity analyses with exclusion of extreme cases and quantile normalization of the phenotype data decreased SNP h(2) as expected under genetic inheritance, but they remained statistically significant for most phenotypes. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the influence of common SNPs on child behavior problems in an ethnically homogenous sample. These results support the continuation of large GWAS collaborative efforts to unravel the genetic basis of complex child behaviors.",

      "abstract": "A systematic understanding of the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their co-occurrence with other conditions during childhood and adolescence remains incomplete. In the current meta-analysis, we synthesized the literature on (1) the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to NDDs, (2) the genetic and environmental overlap between different NDDs, and (3) the co-occurrence between NDDs and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders (DICCs). Searches were conducted across three platforms: Web of Science, Ovid Medline and Ovid Embase. Studies were included only if 75% or more of the sample consisted of children and/or adolescents and the studies had measured the aetiology of NDDs and DICCs using single-generation family designs or genomic methods. Studies that had selected participants on the basis of unrelated diagnoses or injuries were excluded. We performed multilevel, random-effects meta-analyses on 296 independent studies, including over four million (partly overlapping) individuals. We further explored developmental trajectories and the moderating roles of gender, measurement, geography and ancestry. We found all NDDs to be substantially heritable (family-based heritability, 0.66 (s.e. = 0.03); SNP heritability, 0.19 (s.e. = 0.03)). Meta-analytic genetic correlations between NDDs were moderate (grand family-based genetic correlation, 0.36 (s.e. = 0.12); grand SNP-based genetic correlation, 0.39 (s.e. = 0.19)) but differed substantially between pairs of disorders. The genetic overlap between NDDs and DICCs was strong (grand family-based genetic correlation, 0.62 (s.e. = 0.20)). While our work provides evidence to inform and potentially guide clinical and educational diagnostic procedures and practice, it also highlights the imbalance in the research effort that has characterized developmental genetics research.",

We applied GenomicSEM common-factor genome wide association study (GWAS) and multivariate transcriptome-wide association (TWAS) analyses to existing GWAS output for six COPCs in order to find genetic variation associated with nociplastic type pain, followed by genetic correlation (linkage-disequilibrium score regression), gene-set and tissue enrichment analyses.

      "abstract": "Regulatory variation plays a major role in complex disease and that cell type-specific binding of transcription factors (TF) is critical to gene regulation. However, assessing the contribution of genetic variation in TF-binding sites to disease heritability is challenging, as binding is often cell type-specific and annotations from directly measured TF binding are not currently available for most cell type-TF pairs. We investigate approaches to annotate TF binding, including directly measured chromatin data and sequence-based predictions. We find that TF-binding annotations constructed by intersecting sequence-based TF-binding predictions with cell type-specific chromatin data explain a large fraction of heritability across a broad set of diseases and corresponding cell types; this strategy of constructing annotations addresses both the limitation that identical sequences may be bound or unbound depending on surrounding chromatin context and the limitation that sequence-based predictions are generally not cell type-specific. We partitioned the heritability of 49 diseases and complex traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression with the baseline-LD model (which is not cell type-specific) plus the new annotations. We determined that 100 bp windows around MotifMap sequenced-based TF-binding predictions intersected with a union of six cell type-specific chromatin marks (imputed using ChromImpute) performed best, with an 58% increase in heritability enrichment compared to the chromatin marks alone (11.6× vs. 7.3×, P = 9 × 10-14 for difference) and a 20% increase in cell type-specific signal conditional on annotations from the baseline-LD model (P = 8 × 10-11 for difference).

      "abstract": "Parents pass on both their genes and environment to offspring, prompting debate about the relative importance of nature versus nurture in the inheritance of complex traits. Advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to quantify an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait via his or her 'polygenic score'. However, part of the risk captured by an individual's polygenic score may actually be attributed to the genotype of their parents. In the most well-studied example of this indirect 'genetic nurture' effect, about half the genetic contribution to educational attainment was found to be attributed to parental alleles, even if those alleles were not inherited by the child. Refractive errors, such as myopia, are a common cause of visual impairment and pose high economic and quality-of-life costs. Despite strong evidence that refractive errors are highly heritable, the extent to which genetic risk is conferred directly via transmitted risk alleles or indirectly via the environment that parents create for their children is entirely unknown. Here, an instrumental variable analysis in 1944 pairs of adult siblings from the United Kingdom was used to quantify the proportion of the genetic risk ('single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability') of refractive error contributed by genetic nurture. We found no evidence of a contribution from genetic nurture: non-within-family SNP-heritability estimate = 0.213 (95% confidence interval 0.134-0.310) and within-family SNP-heritability estimate = 0.250 (0.152-0.372).

      "abstract": "Heritability is a fundamental concept in genetic studies, measuring the genetic contribution to complex traits and bringing insights about disease mechanisms. The advance of high-throughput technologies has provided many resources for heritability estimation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC) estimates both heritability and confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification, among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by using only summary statistics released from genome-wide association studies. However, only partial information in the LD matrix is utilized in LDSC, leading to loss in precision. In this study, we propose LD eigenvalue regression (LDER), an extension of LDSC, by making full use of the LD information. Compared to state-of-the-art heritability estimating methods, LDER provides more accurate estimates of SNP heritability and better distinguishes the inflation caused by polygenicity and confounding effects. We demonstrate the advantages of LDER both theoretically and with extensive simulations. We applied LDER to 814 complex traits from UK Biobank, and LDER identified 363 significantly heritable phenotypes, among which 97 were not identified by LDSC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) identify high-risk individuals more likely to benefit from primary prevention statin therapy. Whether polygenic CAD risk is captured by conventional paradigms for assessing clinical cardiovascular risk remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to intersect polygenic risk with guideline-based recommendations and management patterns for CAD primary prevention. METHODS: A genome-wide CAD PRS was applied to 47,108 individuals across 3 U.S. health care systems. The authors then assessed whether primary prevention patients at high polygenic risk might be distinguished on the basis of greater guideline-recommended statin eligibility and higher rates of statin therapy. RESULTS: Of 47,108 study participants, the mean age was 60 years, and 11,020 (23.4%) had CAD. The CAD PRS strongly associated with prevalent CAD (odds ratio: 1.4 per SD increase in PRS; p < 0.0001). High polygenic risk (top 20% of PRS) conferred 1.9-fold odds of developing CAD (p < 0.0001). However, among primary prevention patients (n = 33,251), high polygenic risk did not correspond with increased recommendations for statin therapy per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (46.2% for those with high PRS vs. 46.8% for all others, p = 0.54) or U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (43.7% vs. 43.7%, p = 0.99) or higher rates of statin prescriptions (25.0% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.04). An additional 4.1% of primary prevention patients may be recommended for statin therapy if high CAD PRS were considered a guideline-based risk-enhancing factor.

METHODS: We constructed polygenic risk scores using GWAS summary data on associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with RA susceptibility. The polygenic risk scores were stratified into quintiles based on levels of significance (ranging from top quintile of polygenic risk scores to bottom quintile). In addition, change in the Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) of radiographic progression over the first 5 years after onset of RA was assessed. The change in SHS over 5 years was stratified according to quartiles, with the top quartile of change in SHS defined as severe radiographic progression (score change of >35 points) and the remaining 3 quartiles defined as nonsevere radiographic progression. Polygenic risk scores were assessed for their ability to predict the SHS status over 5 years in a training set (n = 500 RA patients) for selection of the best model, and in a testing set (n = 740 RA patients) for validation of the data. We evaluated the performance of the polygenic risk score as a predictor of severe radiographic progression in univariable and multivariable analyses with inclusion of other factors. RESULTS: Polygenic risk scores constructed from 43,784 single-nucleotide polymorphisms significantly differed between patients who experienced severe radiographic progression and those with nonsevere radiographic progression in both the training set (P = 0.0064) and the testing set (P = 0.017). Patients with polygenic risk scores in the top quintile had a higher risk of severe progression compared to those with polygenic risk scores in the bottom quintile (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, P = 0.0022), and the risk of severe radiographic progression was even higher when restricted to patients who were younger at disease onset (OR 5.06, P = 0.00038). The group with polygenic risk scores in the top quintile and the anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive group had significantly higher proportions of patients with severe radiographic progression (P = 0.00052 and P = 0.0022, respectively) compared to the remaining groups. Multivariable analysis showed that polygenic risk score (P = 0.00019) as well as female sex (P = 0.0033), ACPA positivity (P = 0.0023), and body mass index (P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for severe radiographic progression.

      "abstract": "Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease that results in patches of depigmented skin and hair. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of vitiligo have identified 50 susceptibility loci. Variants at the associated loci are generally common and have individually small effects on risk. Most vitiligo cases are \"simplex,\" where there is no family history of vitiligo, though occasional family clustering of vitiligo occurs, and some \"multiplex\" families report numerous close affected relatives. Here, we investigate whether simplex and multiplex vitiligo comprise different disease subtypes with different underlying genetic etiologies. We developed and compared the performance of several different vitiligo polygenic risk scores derived from GWAS data. By using the best-performing risk score, we find increased polygenic burden of risk alleles identified by GWAS in multiplex vitiligo cases relative to simplex cases. We additionally find evidence of polygenic transmission of common, low-effect-size risk alleles within multiplex-vitiligo-affected families. Our findings strongly suggest that family clustering of vitiligo involves a high burden of the same common, low-effect-size variants that are relevant in simplex cases. We furthermore find that a variant within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region contributes disproportionately more to risk in multiplex vitiligo cases than in simplex cases, supporting a special role for adaptive immune triggering in the etiology of multiplex cases. We suggest that genetic risk scores can be a useful tool in analyzing the genetic architecture of clinical disease subtypes and identifying subjects with unusual etiologies for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Cancers, including cutaneous melanoma, can cluster in families. In addition to environmental etiological factors such as ultraviolet radiation, cutaneous melanoma has a strong genetic component. Genetic risks for cutaneous melanoma range from rare, high-penetrance mutations to common, low-penetrance variants. Known high-penetrance mutations account for only about half of all densely affected cutaneous melanoma families, and the causes of familial clustering in the remainder are unknown. We hypothesize that some clustering is due to the cumulative effect of a large number of variants of individually small effect. Common, low-penetrance genetic risk variants can be combined into polygenic risk scores. We used a polygenic risk score for cutaneous melanoma to compare families without known high-penetrance mutations with unrelated melanoma cases and melanoma-free controls. Family members had significantly higher mean polygenic load for cutaneous melanoma than unrelated cases or melanoma-free healthy controls (Bonferroni-corrected t-test P = 1.5 × 10-5 and 6.3 × 10-45, respectively). Whole genome sequencing of germline DNA from 51 members of 21 families with low polygenic risk for melanoma identified a CDKN2A p.G101W mutation in a single family but no other candidate high-penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes. This work provides further evidence that melanoma, like many other common complex disorders, can arise from the joint action of multiple predisposing factors, including rare high-penetrance mutations, as well as via a combination of large numbers of alleles of small effect.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Genetic information is not being used to identify women at lower risk of breast cancer or other diseases in clinical practice. With the new US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines lowering the age for mammogram screening for all, there is a potential benefit in identifying women at lower risk of disease who may defer the start of mammographic screening. This genetic risk-based approach would help mitigate overscreening, associated costs, and anxiety. OBJECTIVE: To assess breast cancer incidence and age of onset among women at low genetic risk compared with women at average risk and evaluate the potential to delay mammography on the basis of genetic risk stratification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective case-control study included 25 591 women from the Healthy Nevada Project sequenced by Helix between 2018 and 2022. Data extracted from electronic health records at the end of 2022 (mean length of electronic health record available was 12 years) were used for the analysis in 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast cancer diagnosis was identified from electronic health records. Classification to the low-risk genetic group required (1) the absence of pathogenic variants or a variant of uncertain significance in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, or CHEK2, and (2) a low polygenic risk score (bottom 10%) using a 313-single-nucleotide variant model. RESULTS: Of 25 591 women in the study (mean [SD] age was 53.8 [16.9] years), 2338 women (9.1%) were classified as having low risk for breast cancer; 410 women (1.6%) were classified as high risk; and 22 843 women (89.3%) as average risk. There was a significant reduction in breast cancer diagnosis among the low-risk group (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52; P < .001). By 45 years of age, 0.69% of women in the average-risk group were diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas women in the low-risk group reached this rate at 51 years. By 50 years of age, 1.41% of those in the average-risk group were diagnosed with breast cancer, whereas those in the low-risk group reached this rate at age 58 years. These findings suggest that deferring mammogram screening by 5 to 10 years for women at low risk of breast cancer aligns with new draft recommendations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this retrospective case-control study underscore the value of genetics in individualizing the onset of breast cancer screening. Improving breast cancer risk stratification by implementing both high-risk and low-risk strategies in screening can refine preventive measures and optimize health care resource allocation.",

Autoantibody surveillance programs effectively prevent most ketoacidosis10-12 but require frequent evaluations whose expense limits public health adoption13. Prevention therapies applied before onset, when greater islet mass remains, have rarely been feasible14 because individuals at greatest risk of impending T1D are difficult to identify. To remedy this, we sought accurate, cost-effective estimation of future T1D risk by developing a combined risk score incorporating both fixed and variable factors (genetic, clinical and immunological) in 7,798 high-risk children followed closely from birth for 9.3 years. Compared with autoantibodies alone, the combined model dramatically improves T1D prediction at ≥2 years of age over horizons up to 8 years of age (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥ 0.9), doubles the estimated efficiency of population-based newborn screening to prevent ketoacidosis, and enables individualized risk estimates for better prevention trial selection.",

Predicting an individual's personal risk of developing melanoma may aid them in undertaking effective risk reduction measures.

We developed the PRS using a matched case-control training dataset ( N  = 16 434) in which age and sex were controlled by design. The combined risk score was developed using a cohort development dataset ( N  = 54 799) and its performance was tested using a cohort testing dataset ( N  = 54 798). Our PRS comprises 68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.639 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.618-0.661]. In the cohort testing data, the hazard ratio per SD of the combined risk score was 1.332 (95% CI = 1.263-1.406). Harrell's C-index was 0.685 (95% CI = 0.654-0.715).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 94 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) risk and 18 associated with ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Several of these are also associated with risk of BC or OC for women who carry a pathogenic mutation in the high-risk BC and OC genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. The combined effects of these variants on BC or OC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have not yet been assessed while their clinical management could benefit from improved personalized risk estimates. METHODS: We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRS) using BC and OC susceptibility SNPs identified through population-based GWAS: for BC (overall, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive, and ER-negative) and for OC. Using data from 15 252 female BRCA1 and 8211 BRCA2 carriers, the association of each PRS with BC or OC risk was evaluated using a weighted cohort approach, with time to diagnosis as the outcome and estimation of the hazard ratios (HRs) per standard deviation increase in the PRS. RESULTS: The PRS for ER-negative BC displayed the strongest association with BC risk in BRCA1 carriers (HR = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.31, P =  8.2×10 -53 ). In BRCA2 carriers, the strongest association with BC risk was seen for the overall BC PRS (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.28, P =  7.2×10 -20 ). The OC PRS was strongly associated with OC risk for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. These translate to differences in absolute risks (more than 10% in each case) between the top and bottom deciles of the PRS distribution; for example, the OC risk was 6% by age 80 years for BRCA2 carriers at the 10th percentile of the OC PRS compared with 19% risk for those at the 90th percentile of PRS. CONCLUSIONS: BC and OC PRS are predictive of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Incorporation of the PRS into risk prediction models has promise to better inform decisions on cancer risk management.",

METHODS: We calculated the polygenic risk score based on genotypes of 66 known prostate cancer loci for 4967 men from the Finnish section of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. We stratified the 72 072 men in the trial into those with polygenic risk below and above the median. Using a maximum likelihood method based on interval cancers, we estimated the mean sojourn time (MST) and episode sensitivity.

RESULTS: Of the prostate cancers, 74% occurred among men with polygenic risk above population median. The sensitivity was 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.65) and MST 6.3 (95% CI 4.2-8.3) years.

We apply a Bayesian Mixture Model, Sex Effects Mixture Model (SEMM), to Genome-wide Association Study summary statistics in order to (1) estimate the contributions of sex to the genetic variance of these biomarkers and (2) identify variants whose statistical association with these traits is sex-specific. We find that the genetics of most biomarker traits are shared between males and females, with the notable exception of testosterone, where we identify 119 female and 445 male-specific variants. These include protein-altering variants in steroid hormone production genes (POR, UGT2B7). Using the sex-specific variants as genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization, we find evidence for causal links between testosterone levels and height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and type 2 diabetes. We also show that sex-specific polygenic risk score models for testosterone outperform a combined model.

However, few studies have investigated the endogenous factors that explain the multifocal disease. The primary objective of the current study is to test whether inherited PCa risk is associated with multifocal tumors in PCa patients. METHODS: Subjects in this study were PCa patients of European ancestry undergoing active surveillance at Johns Hopkins Hospital (N = 805) and NorthShore University HealthSystem (N = 432). The inherited risk was measured by genetic risk score (GRS), an odds ratio-weighted and population-standardized polygenic risk score based on known risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. PCa multifocality was indirectly measured by the number and laterality of positive tumor cores from a 12-core systematic biopsy. RESULTS: In the combined cohort, 35.7% and 66.3% of patients had ≥2 tumor cores at the initial diagnostic biopsy and on at least one subsequent surveillance biopsy, respectively. For tumor laterality, 7.8% and 47.8% of patients had bilateral tumor cores at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively. We found, for the first time, that patients with higher numbers of positive cores at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively, had significantly higher mean GRS values; p = .01 and p = 5.94E-04. Additionally, patients with bilateral tumors at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively, had significantly higher mean GRS values than those with unilateral tumors; p = .04 and p = .01. In contrast, no association was found between GRS and maximum core length of tumor or tumor grade at diagnostic/surveillance biopsies (all p > .05). Finally, we observed a modest trend that patients with higher GRS quartiles had a higher risk for tumor upgrading on surveillance biopsies. The trend, however, was not statistically significant (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The associations of GRS with two measurements of PCa multifocality (core numbers and laterality) provide novel and consistent evidence for the link between inherited PCa risk and multifocal tumors.",

We used a BMI polygenic risk score (PRS) to study the interplay between the genetic and environmental factors defining BMI. First, we generated a BMI PRS that explained more variance than a BMI genetic risk score (GRS), which was using only genome-wide significant BMI-associated variants (R2 = 13.1% compared to 6.1%). Second, we analyzed interactions between BMI PRS and seven environmental factors. We found a significant interaction between physical activity and BMI PRS, even when the well-known effect of the FTO region was excluded from the PRS, using a small dataset of 6,179 samples. Third, we stratified the study population into two risk groups using BMI PRS. The top 22% of the studied populations were included in a high PRS risk group. Engagement in self-reported physical activity was associated with a 1.66 kg/m2 decrease in BMI in this group, compared to a 0.84 kg/m2 decrease in BMI in the rest of the population.

This prospective study aimed to examine the association between secondhand smoke exposure, exposure time, and the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and determine whether this association was influenced by genetic susceptibility. METHODS: The study included 214244 participants of the UK Biobank who were initially free of CKD. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the associations between secondhand smoke exposure time and the risks of CKD in people who have never smoked. The genetic risk score for CKD was calculated by a weighted method. The likelihood ratio test comparing models was used to examine the cross-product term between secondhand smoke exposure and genetic susceptibility to CKD outcomes. RESULTS: During a median of 11.9 years of follow-up, 6583 incidents of CKD were documented. Secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of CKD (HR=1.09; 95% CI: 1.03-1.16, p<0.01), and a dose-response relationship between CKD prevalence and secondhand smoke exposure time was found (p for trend<0.01). Secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of CKD even in people who never smoke and have a low genetic risk (HR=1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.26, p=0.02). There was no statistically significant interaction between secondhand smoke exposure and genetic susceptibility to CKD (p for interaction=0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Secondhand smoke exposure is associated with higher risk of CKD, even in people with low genetic risk, and the relationship is dose dependent. These findings change the belief that people with low genetic susceptibility and without direct participation in smoking activities are not prone to CKD, emphasizing the need to avoid the harm of secondhand smoke in public places.",

METHODS: We analyzed trajectories (N ≈1135) for four neuropsychological composite scores using mixed effects regression for longitudinal change across APOE scores and PRS of participants in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, a longitudinal study of adults aged 40 to 70 at baseline, with a median participant follow-up time of 7.8 years. RESULTS: We found a significant non-linear age-by-APOE score interaction in predicting cognitive decline. Cognitive trajectories diverged by APOE score at approximately 65 years of age. A 0.5 standard deviation difference in cognition between extreme percentiles of the PRS was predicted to occur 1 to 2 years before that of the APOE score. DISCUSSION: Cognitive decline differs across time and APOE score. Estimates did not substantially shift with the AD PRS. HIGHLIGHTS: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) score, a continuous measure, accounts for non-linear genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. Non-linear age interacts with the APOE score to affect cognition. Cognitive decline starts to differ by APOE score levels at approximately age 65. Cognitive decline timing by polygenic risk (including APOE) is similar to APOE alone.",

      "abstract": "Practical application of genomic-based risk stratification to clinical diagnosis is appealing yet performance varies widely depending on the disease and genomic risk score (GRS) method. Celiac disease (CD), a common immune-mediated illness, is strongly genetically determined and requires specific HLA haplotypes. HLA testing can exclude diagnosis but has low specificity, providing little information suitable for clinical risk stratification. Using six European cohorts, we provide a proof-of-concept that statistical learning approaches which simultaneously model all SNPs can generate robust and highly accurate predictive models of CD based on genome-wide SNP profiles. The high predictive capacity replicated both in cross-validation within each cohort (AUC of 0.87-0.89) and in independent replication across cohorts (AUC of 0.86-0.9), despite differences in ethnicity. The models explained 30-35% of disease variance and up to ∼43% of heritability. The GRS's utility was assessed in different clinically relevant settings. Comparable to HLA typing, the GRS can be used to identify individuals without CD with ≥99.6% negative predictive value however, unlike HLA typing, fine-scale stratification of individuals into categories of higher-risk for CD can identify those that would benefit from more invasive and costly definitive testing. The GRS is flexible and its performance can be adapted to the clinical situation by adjusting the threshold cut-off. Despite explaining a minority of disease heritability, our findings indicate a genomic risk score provides clinically relevant information to improve upon current diagnostic pathways for CD and support further studies evaluating the clinical utility of this approach in CD and other complex diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is one of the most heritable diseases in elderly people and the most common type of dementia. In addition to the major genetic determinant of Alzheimer's disease, the APOE gene, 23 genetic variants have been associated with the disease. We assessed the effects of these variants and APOE on cumulative risk and age at onset of Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia. METHODS: We studied incident dementia in cognitively healthy participants (aged >45 years) from the community-based Rotterdam Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, focusing on neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, and ophthalmological disorders, and other diseases in elderly people. The Rotterdam Study comprises participants in three baseline cohorts (initiated in 1990, 2000, and 2006), who are re-invited to the research centre every 3-4 years, and continuously monitored by records from general practitioners and medical specialists. Cumulative incidence curves up to age 100 years were calculated for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, taking into account mortality as a competing event. These risk curves were stratified by APOE genotypes, tertiles of a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) of 23 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic variants, and parental history of dementia. FINDINGS: 12 255 of 14 926 participants (58·5% women) from the Rotterdam Study were included in this study. During a median follow-up of 11·0 years (IQR 4·9-15·9; 133 123 person years), 1609 participants developed dementia, of whom 1262 (78%) were classified as having Alzheimer's disease; 3310 people died of causes other than dementia. Both APOE and the GRS significantly modified the risks of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. There was evidence for a significant interaction between APOE genotypes and the GRS for the association with Alzheimer's disease (p=0·03) and dementia (p=0·04); the risk for carriers homozygous for APOE ε4 was modified most by the GRS. In carriers homozygous for APOE ε4, the difference between the high-risk tertile and the low-risk tertile by age 85 years was 27·0% for Alzheimer's disease (p=8·5 × 10 INTERPRETATION: Common variants with small individual effects jointly modify the risk and age at onset of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, particularly in APOE ε4 carriers.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin screening is associated with higher melanoma detection rates, a potential indicator of overdiagnosis, but it remains possible that this effect is due to confounding by genetic risk. OBJECTIVES: To compare melanoma incidence among screened vs. unscreened participants within tertiles of genetic risk. METHODS: We investigated melanoma incidence in the QSkin study, a prospective cohort study which for this analysis comprised 15 283 participants aged 40-69 years with genotype data and no prior history of melanoma. We calculated a polygenic score (PGS) for melanoma. We first calculated the age-standardized rate (ASR) of melanoma within PGS tertiles, and then measured the association between skin examination and melanoma detection by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), overall and within PGS tertiles. RESULTS: Melanoma incidence increased with PGS (ASR per 100 000 per year): tertile 1 = 442; tertile 2 = 519; tertile 3 = 871. We found that the HRs for all melanomas (i.e. in situ and invasive) associated with skin examination differed slightly across PGS tertiles [age- and sex-adjusted tertile 1 HR 1.88 (95% CI 1.26-2.81); tertile 2 HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.20-2.41); tertile 3 HR 1.96 (95% CI 1.43-2.70); fully adjusted tertile 1 HR 1.14 (95% CI 0.74-1.75); tertile 2 HR 1.21 (95% CI 0.82-1.78); tertile 3 HR 1.41 (95% CI 1.00-1.98)], but these differences were not statistically significant. HRs for in situ melanoma associated with skin examination were similar across PGS tertiles. For invasive melanomas, the point estimates appeared to be highest in PGS tertile 3 in both the minimally adjusted (age, sex) and fully adjusted models; however, these apparent differences were also not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk predicts subsequent melanoma incidence, and is weakly associated with screening behaviour, but it does not explain the higher rate of melanoma detection between screened and unscreened people.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a heritable atherosclerotic condition associated with functional decline and high risk for limb loss. With growing knowledge of the genetic basis for PAD and related risk factors, there is potential opportunity to identify individuals at high risk using polygenic risk scores (PRSs). OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel integrated, multiancestry polygenic score for PAD (PRS-PAD) and evaluate its risk estimation for PAD and major adverse limb events in 3 populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study was conducted among individuals with genotyping and electronic health record data in the UK Biobank (2006-2021), All of Us (AoU, 2018-2022), and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, 2010-2023). Data were analyzed from July 2023 to February 2025. EXPOSURES: PRS-PAD, previously published PAD polygenic scores, and clinical risk factors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were PAD and major adverse limb events, defined as a surrogate of major amputation and acute limb ischemia. RESULTS: The study populations included 400 533 individuals from the UK Biobank (median [IQR] age, 58.2 [45.0-71.4] years; 216 215 female participants [53.9%]), 218 500 from AoU (median [IQR] age, 53.6 [37.7-65.0] years; 132 647 female participants [60.7%]), and 32 982 from MGBB (median [IQR] age, 56.0 [32.0-80.0] years; 18 277 female participants [55.4%]). In the UK Biobank validation cohort, PRS-PAD was associated with an odds ratio [OR] per SD increase of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.60-1.68; P < .001). After adjusting for clinical risk factors, the OR for the top 20% of PRS-PAD was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.62-1.74; P < .001) compared to the remainder of the population. Among PAD cases without a history of diabetes, smoking, or chronic kidney disease (n = 3645), 1097 individuals (30.1%) had a high PRS-PAD (top 20%). In incident disease analysis, PRS-PAD improved discrimination (C statistic, 0.761), which was nearly equivalent to the performances of diabetes (C statistic, 0.760) and smoking (C statistic, 0.765). Among individuals with prevalent PAD, high PRS-PAD was associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse limb events in the UK Biobank (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.18-2.57; P = .005), MGBB (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.30; P = .02), and AoU (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06-2.33; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study develops a new PRS that stratifies risk of PAD and adverse limb outcomes. Incorporating polygenic risk into PAD care warrants further investigation to guide screening and tailor management to prevent major adverse limb events.",

Among these susceptibility loci, a common non-coding variant in TTN (rs1484116) was associated with reduced cardiac function and worse long-term mortality. We leveraged the HF meta-GWASs along with cardiac function-related GWASs to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for HF.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed numerous loci for kidney function (eGFR). The relationship between polygenic predictors of eGFR, risk of incident adverse kidney outcomes, and the plasma proteome is not known. METHODS: We developed a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) for eGFR by applying the LDpred algorithm to summary statistics generated from a multiethnic meta-analysis of CKDGen Consortium GWAS ( n =765,348) and UK Biobank GWAS (90% of the cohort; n =451,508), followed by best-parameter selection using the remaining 10% of UK Biobank data ( n =45,158). We then tested the association of the PRS in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study ( n =8866) with incident CKD, ESKD, kidney failure, and AKI. We also examined associations between the PRS and 4877 plasma proteins measured at middle age and older adulthood and evaluated mediation of PRS associations by eGFR. RESULTS: The developed PRS showed a significant association with all outcomes. Hazard ratios per 1 SD lower PRS ranged from 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.11) to 1.33 (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.37). The PRS was significantly associated with 132 proteins at both time points. The strongest associations were with cystatin C, collagen α -1(XV) chain, and desmocollin-2. Most proteins were higher at lower kidney function, except for five proteins, including testican-2. Most correlations of the genetic PRS with proteins were mediated by eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: A PRS for eGFR is now sufficiently strong to capture risk for a spectrum of incident kidney diseases and broadly influences the plasma proteome, primarily mediated by eGFR.",

GPSMult strongly associated with prevalent CAD (odds ratio per standard deviation 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.10-2.19, P < 0.001) in UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, identifying 20.0% of the population with 3-fold increased risk and conversely 13.9% with 3-fold decreased risk as compared with those in the middle quintile.

Herein, we tested the contribution of genetic background to such interindividual variability after biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. METHODS: Percentage of excess body weight loss (%EBWL) was monitored in 865 patients over a period of 48 months after bariatric surgery, and two polygenic risk scores were constructed with 186 and 11 (PRS186 and PRS11) single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: The accuracy of the %EBWL logistic prediction model - including initial BMI, age, sex, and surgery modality, and assessed as the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve adjusted for optimism (AUCadj = 0.867) - significantly increased after the inclusion of PRS186 (ΔAUCadj = 0.021; 95% CI of the difference [95% CIdiff] = 0.005-0.038) but not PRS11 (ΔAUCadj= 0.008; 95% CIdiff= -0.003-0.019). The overall fit of the longitudinal linear mixed model for %EBWL showed a significant increase after addition of PRS186 (-2 log-likelihood = 12.3; P = 0.002) and PRS11 (-2 log-likelihood = 9.9; P = 0.007). A significant interaction with postsurgery time was found for PRS186 (β = -0.003; P = 0.008) and PRS11 (β = -0.008; P = 0.03). The inclusion of PRS186 and PRS11 in the model improved the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery by reducing the percentage of false negatives from 20.4% to 10.9% and 10.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that genetic background has a significant impact on weight loss after biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Likewise, the improvement in weight loss prediction after addition of polygenic risk scores is cost-effective, suggesting that genetic testing could potentially be used in the presurgical assessment of patients with severe obesity.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using meta-analytic approach and large genome-wide association results for CAD and CAD-related traits in East Asians, a PRS comprising 540 genetic variants was developed in a training set of 2800 patients with CAD and 2055 controls, and was further assessed for risk stratification for CAD integrating with the guideline-recommended clinical risk score in large prospective cohorts comprising 41 271 individuals. During a mean follow-up of 13.0 years, 1303 incident CAD cases were identified. Individuals with high PRS (the highest 20%) had about three-fold higher risk of CAD than the lowest 20% (hazard ratio 2.91, 95% confidence interval 2.43-3.49), with the lifetime risk of 15.9 and 5.8%, respectively. The addition of PRS to the clinical risk score yielded a modest yet significant improvement in C-statistic (1%) and net reclassification improvement (3.5%). We observed significant gradients in both 10-year and lifetime risk of CAD according to the PRS within each clinical risk strata. Particularly, when integrating high PRS, intermediate clinical risk individuals with uncertain clinical decision for intervention would reach the risk levels (10-year of 4.6 vs. 4.8%, lifetime of 17.9 vs. 16.6%) of high clinical risk individuals with intermediate (20-80%) PRS. CONCLUSION: The PRS could stratify individuals into different trajectories of CAD risk, and further refine risk stratification for CAD within each clinical risk strata, demonstrating a great potential to identify high-risk individuals for targeted intervention in clinical utility.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) has substantial heritability and a polygenic architecture. However, the potential of genomic risk scores to help predict CAD outcomes has not been evaluated comprehensively, because available studies have involved limited genomic scope and limited sample sizes. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to construct a genomic risk score for CAD and to estimate its potential as a screening tool for primary prevention. METHODS: Using a meta-analytic approach to combine large-scale, genome-wide, and targeted genetic association data, we developed a new genomic risk score for CAD (metaGRS) consisting of 1.7 million genetic variants. We externally tested metaGRS, both by itself and in combination with available data on conventional risk factors, in 22,242 CAD cases and 460,387 noncases from the UK Biobank. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for CAD was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68 to 1.73) per SD increase in metaGRS, an association larger than any other externally tested genetic risk score previously published. The metaGRS stratified individuals into significantly different life course trajectories of CAD risk, with those in the top 20% of metaGRS distribution having an HR of 4.17 (95% CI: 3.97 to 4.38) compared with those in the bottom 20%.

The metaGRS had a higher C-index (C = 0.623; 95% CI: 0.615 to 0.631) for incident CAD than any of 6 conventional factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, self-reported high cholesterol, and family history). For men in the top 20% of metaGRS with >2 conventional factors, 10% cumulative risk of CAD was reached by 48 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic score developed and evaluated here substantially advances the concept of using genomic information to stratify individuals with different trajectories of CAD risk and highlights the potential for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The etiology of male breast cancer (MBC) is poorly understood. In particular, the extent to which the genetic basis of MBC differs from female breast cancer (FBC) is unknown. A previous genome-wide association study of MBC identified 2 predisposition loci for the disease, both of which were also associated with risk of FBC. METHODS: We performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of European ancestry MBC case subjects and controls in 3 stages. Associations between directly genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms with MBC were assessed using fixed-effects meta-analysis of 1380 cases and 3620 controls. Replication genotyping of 810 cases and 1026 controls was used to validate variants with P values less than 1 × 10-06. Genetic correlation with FBC was evaluated using linkage disequilibrium score regression, by comprehensively examining the associations of published FBC risk loci with risk of MBC and by assessing associations between a FBC polygenic risk score and MBC. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: The genome-wide association study identified 3 novel MBC susceptibility loci that attained genome-wide statistical significance (P < 5 × 10-08). Genetic correlation analysis revealed a strong shared genetic basis with estrogen receptor-positive FBC. Men in the top quintile of genetic risk had a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer relative to those in the bottom quintile (odds ratio = 3.86, 95% confidence interval = 3.07 to 4.87, P = 2.08 × 10-30). CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of MBC, providing support for an overlapping genetic etiology with FBC and identifying a fourfold high-risk group of susceptible men.",

We found that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improved prediction over conventional risk factors for all diseases. Gut microbiome scores improved predictive capacity over baseline age for CAD, T2D and prostate cancer.

      "abstract": "AIMS: This study uses a high-resolution phenome-wide approach to evaluate the motivational mechanisms of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that have been robustly associated with coarse alcohol phenotypes in large-scale studies. METHODS: In a community-based sample of 1534 Europeans, we examined genome-wide PRSs for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), drinks per week, alcohol use disorder (AUD), problematic alcohol use (PAU), and general addiction, in relation to 42 curated phenotypes. The curated phenotypes were in seven categories: alcohol consumption, alcohol reinforcing value, drinking motives, other addictive behaviors, commonly comorbid psychiatric syndromes, impulsivity, and personality traits. RESULTS: The PRS for each alcohol phenotype was validated via its within-sample association with the corresponding phenotype (adjusted R2s = 0.35-1.68%, Ps = 0.012-3.6 × 10-7) with the exception of AUD. All PRSs were positively associated with alcohol reinforcing value and drinking motives, with the strongest effects from AUDIT-consumption (adjusted R2s = 0.45-1.33%, Ps = 0.006-3.6 × 10-5) and drinks per week PRSs (adjusted R2s = 0.52-2.28%, Ps = 0.004-6.6 × 10-9). Furthermore, the PAU and drinks per week PRSs were positively associated with adverse childhood experiences (adjusted R2s = 0.6-0.7%, Ps = 0.0001-4.8 × 10-4). CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate alcohol reinforcing value and drinking motives as genetically-influenced mechanisms using PRSs for the first time. The findings also highlight the value of dissecting genetic influence on alcohol involvement through diverse phenotypic risk pathways but also the need for future studies with both phenotypic richness and larger samples.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Adult height is highly heritable, yet no genetic predictor has demonstrated clinical utility compared to mid-parental height. OBJECTIVE: To develop a polygenic risk score for adult height and evaluate its clinical utility. DESIGN: A polygenic risk score was constructed based on meta-analysis of genomewide association studies and evaluated on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. SUBJECTS: Participants included 442 599 genotyped White British individuals in the UK Biobank and 941 genotyped child-parent trios of European ancestry in the ALSPAC cohort. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standing height was measured using stadiometer; Standing height 2 SDs below the sex-specific population average was considered as short stature. RESULTS: Combined with sex, a polygenic risk score captured 71.1% of the total variance in adult height in the UK Biobank. In the ALSPAC cohort, the polygenic risk score was able to identify children who developed adulthood short stature with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84, which is close to that of mid-parental height. Combining this polygenic risk score with mid-parental height or only one of the child's parent's height could improve the AUROC to at most 0.90. The polygenic risk score could also substitute mid-parental height in age-specific Khamis-Roche height predictors and achieve an equally strong discriminative power in identifying children with a short stature in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: A polygenic risk score could be considered as an alternative or adjunct to mid-parental height to improve screening for children at risk of developing short stature in adulthood in European ancestry populations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency, caused by mutations in MC4R, is the most common cause of monogenic forms of obesity. However, these mutations have often been identified in small-scale, case-focused studies. Here, we assess the penetrance of previously reported MC4R mutations at a population level. Furthermore, we examine why some carriers of pathogenic mutations remain of normal weight, to gain insight into the mechanisms that control body weight. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified 59 known obesity-increasing mutations in MC4R from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and Clinvar. We assessed their penetrance and effect on obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) in >450,000 individuals (age 40-69 years) of the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort study. Of these 59 mutations, only 11 had moderate-to-high penetrance and increased the odds of obesity by more than 2-fold. We subsequently focused on these 11 mutations and examined differences between carriers of normal weight and carriers with obesity. Twenty-eight of the 182 carriers of these 11 mutations were of normal weight. Body composition of carriers of normal weight was similar to noncarriers of normal weight, whereas among individuals with obesity, carriers had a somewhat higher BMI than noncarriers (1.44 ± 0.07 standard deviation scores [SDSs] ± standard error [SE] versus 1.29 ± 0.001, P = 0.03), because of greater lean mass (1.44 ± 0.09 versus 1.15 ± 0.002, P = 0.002). Carriers of normal weight more often reported that, already at age 10 years, their body size was below average or average (72%) compared with carriers with obesity (48%) (P = 0.01). To assess the polygenic contribution to body weight in carriers of normal weight and carriers with obesity, we calculated a genome-wide polygenic risk score for BMI (PRSBMI). The PRSBMI of carriers of normal weight (PRSBMI = -0.64 ± 0.18) was significantly lower than of carriers with obesity (0.40 ± 0.11; P = 1.7 × 10-6), and tended to be lower than that of noncarriers of normal weight (-0.29 ± 0.003; P = 0.05). Among carriers, those with a low PRSBMI (bottom quartile) have an approximately 5-kg/m2 lower BMI (approximately 14 kg of body weight for a 1.7-m-tall person) than those with a high PRS (top quartile). Because the UK Biobank population is healthier than the general population in the United Kingdom, penetrance may have been somewhat underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that large-scale data are needed to validate the impact of mutations observed in small-scale and case-focused studies. Furthermore, we observed that despite the key role of MC4R in obesity, the effects of pathogenic MC4R mutations may be countered, at least in part, by a low polygenic risk potentially representing other innate mechanisms implicated in body weight regulation.",

Sex-stratified regression models were used to estimate the relationship between the PRS and age at gout onset and tophaceous disease. RESULTS: The PRS was associated with earlier age at gout onset in men (β = -3.61 in years per unit PRS [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -4.32, -2.90] in European men; β = -6.35 [95% CI -8.91, -3.80] in East Polynesian men; β = -3.51 [95% CI -5.46, -1.57] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (β = 0.07 [95% CI -2.32, 2.45] in European women; β = 0.20 [95% CI -7.21, 7.62] in East Polynesian women; β -3.33 [95% CI -9.28, 2.62] in West Polynesian women). The PRS showed a positive association with tophaceous disease in men (odds ratio [OR] for the association 1.15 [95% CI 1.00, 1.31] in European men; OR 2.60 [95% CI 1.66, 4.06] in East Polynesian men; OR 1.53 [95% CI 1.07, 2.19] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (OR for the association 0.68 [95% CI 0.42, 1.10] in European women; OR 1.45 [95% CI 0.39, 5.36] in East Polynesian women). The PRS association with age at gout onset was robust to the removal of ABCG2 variants from the PRS in European and East Polynesian men (β = -2.42 [95% CI -3.37, -1.46] and β = -6.80 [95% CI -10.06, -3.55], respectively) but not in West Polynesian men (β = -1.79 [95% CI -4.74, 1.16]). CONCLUSION: Genetic risk variants for gout also harbor risk for earlier age at gout onset and tophaceous disease in European and Polynesian men. Our findings suggest that earlier gout onset involves the accumulation of gout risk alleles in men but perhaps not in women, and that this genetic risk is shared across multiple ancestral groups.",

Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) can help to quantify that risk, but the broader impacts of polygenic risk for CAD are not well characterized. METHODS: We measured polygenic risk for CAD using the meta genomic risk score, a previously validated genome-wide PRS, in a subset of genotyped participants from the Women's Health Initiative and applied a phenome-wide association study framework to assess associations between the PRS and a broad range of blood biomarkers, clinical measurements, and health outcomes. RESULTS: Polygenic risk for CAD is associated with a variety of biomarkers, clinical measurements, behaviors, and diagnoses related to traditional risk factors, as well as risk-enhancing factors. Analysis of adjudicated outcomes shows a graded association between atherosclerosis related outcomes, with the highest odds ratios being observed for the most severe manifestations of CAD. We find associations between increased polygenic risk for CAD and decreased risk for incident breast and lung cancer, with replication of the breast cancer finding in an external cohort. Genetic correlation and two-sample Mendelian randomization suggest that breast cancer association is likely due to horizontal pleiotropy, while the association with lung cancer may be causal. CONCLUSION: Polygenic risk for CAD has broad clinical manifestations, reflected in biomarkers, clinical measurements, behaviors, and diagnoses. Some of these associations may represent direct pathways between genetic risk and CAD while others may reflect pleiotropic effects independent of CAD risk.",

The role of genetic information in predicting myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) remains unknown and requires large scale electronic health record and genomic data sets. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study of adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, we defined MINS as new troponin elevation within 30 days following surgery. To determine the incremental value of polygenic risk score (PRS) for coronary artery disease, we added the score to 3 models of MINS risk: revised cardiac risk index, a model comprised entirely of preoperative variables, and a model with combined preoperative plus intraoperative variables. We assessed performance without and with PRSs via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and net reclassification index. RESULTS: Among 90 053 procedures across 40 498 genotyped individuals, we observed 429 cases with MINS (0.5%). PRS for coronary artery disease was independently associated with MINS for each multivariable model created (odds ratio=1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24],  CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a PRS does not significantly improve discrimination but remains independently associated with MINS and improves goodness of fit. As genetic analysis becomes more common, clinicians will have an opportunity to use polygenic risk to predict perioperative complications. Further studies are necessary to determine if PRSs can inform MINS surveillance.",

      "abstract": "Genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants and differentially methylated nucleotides associated with childhood asthma. Incorporation of such genomic data may improve performance of childhood asthma prediction models which use phenotypic and environmental data. Using genome-wide genotype and methylation data at birth from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n = 1456), a polygenic risk score (PRS), and newborn (nMRS) and childhood (cMRS) methylation risk scores, were developed to predict childhood asthma diagnosis. Each risk score was integrated with two previously published childhood asthma prediction models (CAPE and CAPP) and were validated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study. Individually, the genomic risk scores demonstrated modest-to-moderate discriminative performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC: PRS = 0.64, nMRS = 0.55, cMRS = 0.54), and their integration only marginally improved the performance of the CAPE (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.71) and CAPP models (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.82). The limited predictive performance of each genomic risk score individually and their inability to substantially improve upon the performance of the CAPE and CAPP models suggests that genetic and epigenetic predictors of the broad phenotype of asthma are unlikely to have clinical utility. Hence, further studies predicting specific asthma endotypes are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Large genome-wide association studies have reported hundreds of genetic markers associated with lipid levels. However, the discovery and estimated effect of variants at these loci, derived from samples of exclusively European descent, may not generalize to the majority of the world populations. We examined the collective strength of association among these loci in a diverse set of U.S. populations from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We constructed a genetic risk score for each lipid outcome based on previously identified lipid-associated genetic markers, and examined the relationship between the genetic risk scores and corresponding outcomes. We discover this relationship was often moderated by race/ethnicity. Our findings provide insight into the generalizability and predictive utility of large sample size meta-analyses results when leveraging data from a single population. We hope these findings will encourage researchers to investigate genetic susceptibility in more diverse populations and explore the source of such discrepancies. Until then, we caution clinicians, genetic counselors, and genetic testing consumers when interpreting genetic data on complex traits.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Automated algorithms to identify individuals with type 1 diabetes using electronic health records are increasingly used in biomedical research. It is not known whether the accuracy of these algorithms differs by self-reported race. We investigated whether polygenic scores improve identification of individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated two large hospital-based biobanks (Mass General Brigham [MGB] and BioMe) and identified individuals with type 1 diabetes using an established automated algorithm. We performed medical record reviews to validate the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. We implemented two published polygenic scores for type 1 diabetes (developed in individuals of European or African ancestry). We assessed the classification algorithm before and after incorporating polygenic scores. RESULTS: The automated algorithm was more likely to incorrectly assign a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in self-reported non-White individuals than in self-reported White individuals (odds ratio 3.45; 95% CI 1.54-7.69; P = 0.0026). After incorporating polygenic scores into the MGB Biobank, the positive predictive value of the type 1 diabetes algorithm increased from 70 to 97% for self-reported White individuals (meaning that 97% of those predicted to have type 1 diabetes indeed had type 1 diabetes) and from 53 to 100% for self-reported non-White individuals. Similar results were found in BioMe. CONCLUSIONS: Automated phenotyping algorithms may exacerbate health disparities because of an increased risk of misclassification of individuals from underrepresented populations. Polygenic scores may be used to improve the performance of phenotyping algorithms and potentially reduce this disparity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The identification of effective dementia prevention strategies is a major public health priority, due to the enormous and growing societal cost of this condition. Consumption of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been proposed to reduce dementia risk. However, current evidence is inconclusive and is typically derived from small cohorts with limited dementia cases. Additionally, few studies have explored the interaction between diet and genetic risk of dementia. METHODS: We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to explore the associations between MedDiet adherence, defined using two different scores (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [MEDAS] continuous and Mediterranean diet Pyramid [PYRAMID] scores), and incident all-cause dementia risk in 60,298 participants from UK Biobank, followed for an average 9.1 years. The interaction between diet and polygenic risk for dementia was also tested. RESULTS: Higher MedDiet adherence was associated with lower dementia risk (MEDAS continuous: HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65-0.91; PYRAMID: HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.73-1.02 for highest versus lowest tertiles). There was no significant interaction between MedDiet adherence defined by the MEDAS continuous and PYRAMID scores and polygenic risk for dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to a MedDiet was associated with lower dementia risk, independent of genetic risk, underlining the importance of diet in dementia prevention interventions.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Polygenic risk scores comprising millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be useful for population-wide coronary heart disease (CHD) screening. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a polygenic risk score improves prediction of CHD compared with a guideline-recommended clinical risk equation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of the predictive accuracy of a previously validated polygenic risk score was assessed among 4847 adults of white European ancestry, aged 45 through 79 years, participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and 2390 participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) from 1996 through December 31, 2015, the final day of follow-up. The performance of the polygenic risk score was compared with that of the 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association pooled cohort equations. EXPOSURES: Genetic risk was computed for each participant by summing the product of the weights and allele dosage across 6 630 149 SNPs. Weights were based on an international genome-wide association study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prediction of 10-year first CHD events (including myocardial infarctions, fatal coronary events, silent infarctions, revascularization procedures, or resuscitated cardiac arrest) assessed using measures of model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification improvement (NRI). RESULTS: The study population included 4847 adults from the ARIC study (mean [SD] age, 62.9 [5.6] years; 56.4% women) and 2390 adults from the MESA cohort (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [9.6] years; 52.2% women). Incident CHD events occurred in 696 participants (14.4%) and 227 participants (9.5%), respectively, over median follow-up of 15.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.3 years) and 14.2 (IQR, 2.5 years) years. The polygenic risk score was significantly associated with 10-year CHD incidence in ARIC with hazard ratios per SD increment of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.34) and in MESA, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.58). Addition of the polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equations did not significantly increase the C statistic in either cohort (ARIC, change in C statistic, -0.001; 95% CI, -0.009 to 0.006; MESA, 0.021; 95% CI, -0.0004 to 0.043). At the 10-year risk threshold of 7.5%, the addition of the polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equations did not provide significant improvement in reclassification in either ARIC (NRI, 0.018, 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.036) or MESA (NRI, 0.001, 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.076). The polygenic risk score did not significantly improve calibration in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of 2 cohorts of US adults, the polygenic risk score was associated with incident coronary heart disease events but did not significantly improve discrimination, calibration, or risk reclassification compared with conventional predictors. These findings suggest that a polygenic risk score may not enhance risk prediction in a general, white middle-aged population.",

A cross-ancestry meta-analysis of >1 million individuals, including 77,690 cases, identified 35 new susceptibility loci. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified IL6R as a putative causal gene, suggesting the involvement of immune responses.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic risk discrimination and reclassification and apply the results for a 2-stage population risk screening strategy for CHD. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We genotyped 28 genetic variants in 24 124 participants in 4 Finnish population-based, prospective cohorts (recruitment years 1992-2002). We constructed a multilocus genetic risk score and evaluated its association with incident cardiovascular disease events. During the median follow-up time of 12 years (interquartile range 8.75-15.25 years), we observed 1093 CHD, 1552 cardiovascular disease, and 731 acute coronary syndrome events. Adding genetic information to conventional risk factors and family history improved risk discrimination of CHD (C-index 0.856 versus 0.851; P=0.0002) and other end points (cardiovascular disease: C-index 0.840 versus 0.837, P=0.0004; acute coronary syndrome: C-index 0.859 versus 0.855, P=0.001). In a standard population of 100 000 individuals, additional genetic screening of subjects at intermediate risk for CHD would reclassify 2144 subjects (12%) into high-risk category. Statin allocation for these subjects is estimated to prevent 135 CHD cases over 14 years. Similar results were obtained by external validation, where the effects were estimated from a training data set and applied for a test data set. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk score improves risk prediction of CHD and helps to identify individuals at high risk for the first CHD event. Genetic screening for individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk could help to prevent future cases through better targeting of statins.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: A polygenic risk score (PRS) consisting of 313 common genetic variants (PRS313) is associated with risk of breast cancer and contralateral breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the PRS313 with clinicopathologic characteristics of, and survival following, breast cancer. Methods: Women with invasive breast cancer were included, 98,397 of European ancestry and 12,920 of Asian ancestry, from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), and 683 women from the European MINDACT trial. Associations between PRS313 and clinicopathologic characteristics, including the 70-gene signature for MINDACT, were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Associations of PRS313 (continuous, per standard deviation) with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were evaluated with Cox regression, adjusted for clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment. Results: The PRS313 was associated with more favorable tumor characteristics. In BCAC, increasing PRS313 was associated with lower grade, hormone receptor-positive status, and smaller tumor size. In MINDACT, PRS313 was associated with a low risk 70-gene signature. In European women from BCAC, higher PRS313 was associated with better OS and BCSS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98), but the association disappeared after adjustment for clinicopathologic characteristics (and treatment): OS HR, 1.01 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.05) and BCSS HR, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.07). The results in MINDACT and Asian women from BCAC were consistent. Conclusion: An increased PRS313 is associated with favorable tumor characteristics, but is not independently associated with prognosis. Thus, PRS313 has no role in the clinical management of primary breast cancer at the time of diagnosis. Nevertheless, breast cancer mortality rates will be higher for women with higher PRS313 as increasing PRS313 is associated with an increased risk of disease. This information is crucial for modeling effective stratified screening programs.",

      "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: South Asians in general, and Asian Indians in particular, have higher risk of type 2 diabetes compared with white Europeans, and a younger age of onset. The reasons for the younger age of onset in relation to obesity, beta cell function and insulin sensitivity are under-explored. METHODS: Two cohorts of Asian Indians, the ICMR-INDIAB cohort (Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes Study) and the DMDSC cohort (Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialties Centre), and one of white Europeans, the ESDC (East Scotland Diabetes Cohort), were used. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined the comparative prevalence of healthy, overweight and obese participants with young-onset diabetes, classified according to their BMI. We explored the role of clinically measured beta cell function in diabetes onset in Asian Indians. Finally, the comparative distribution of a partitioned polygenic score (pPS) for risk of diabetes due to poor beta cell function was examined. Replication of the genetic findings was sought using data from the UK Biobank. RESULTS: The prevalence of young-onset diabetes with normal BMI was 9.3% amongst white Europeans and 24-39% amongst Asian Indians. In Asian Indians with young-onset diabetes, after adjustment for family history of type 2 diabetes, sex, insulin sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol, stimulated C-peptide was 492 pmol/ml (IQR 353-616, p<0.0001) lower in lean compared with obese individuals. Asian Indians in our study, and South Asians from the UK Biobank, had a higher number of risk alleles than white Europeans. After weighting the pPS for beta cell function, Asian Indians have lower genetically determined beta cell function than white Europeans (p<0.0001). The pPS was associated with age of diagnosis in Asian Indians but not in white Europeans. The pPS explained 2% of the variation in clinically measured beta cell function, and 1.2%, 0.97%, and 0.36% of variance in age of diabetes amongst Asian Indians with normal BMI, or classified as overweight and obese BMI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of lean BMI in young-onset diabetes is over two times higher in Asian Indians compared with white Europeans. This phenotype of lean, young-onset diabetes appears driven in part by lower beta cell function. We demonstrate that Asian Indians with diabetes also have lower genetically determined beta cell function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to the development of asthma, but whether unfavourable lifestyle is associated with similar increases in risk of developing asthma among individuals with varying genetic risk levels remains unknown. METHODS: A healthy lifestyle score was constructed using body mass index, smoking status, physical activities and dietary pattern to further categorise into ideal, intermediate and poor groups. Genetic risk of asthma was also categorised as three groups based on the tertiles of polygenic risk score established using 212 reported and verified single-nucleotide polymorphisms of European ancestry in the UK Biobank study. We examined the risk of incident asthma related with each lifestyle level in each genetic risk group by Cox regression models. RESULTS: Finally, 327 124 participants without baseline asthma were included, and 157 320 (48.1%) were male. During follow-up, 6238 participants (1.9%) developed asthma. Compared to ideal lifestyle in a low genetic risk group, poor lifestyle was associated with a hazard ratio of up to 3.87 (95% CI, 2.98-5.02) for developing asthma in a high genetic risk group. There was interaction between genetic risk and lifestyle, and the population-attributable fraction of lifestyle and genetic risk were 30.2% and 30.0% respectively. CONCLUSION: In this large contemporary population, lifestyle and genetic factors jointly play critical roles in the development of asthma, and the effect values of lifestyle on incident adult-onset asthma were greater than that of genetic risk. Our findings highlighted the necessity of a comprehensive intervention for the prevention of asthma despite the genetic risk.",

CYP2A6 is responsible for nicotine's metabolic inactivation and variation in the NMR/CYP2A6 is associated with several smoking behaviors. Our aim was to integrate established alleles and novel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) signals to create a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for the CYP2A6 gene for European-ancestry populations. The wGRS was compared with a previous CYP2A6 gene scoring approach designed for an alternative phenotype (C2/N2; cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2 + cotinine-d2)). CYP2A6 genotypes and the NMR were assessed in European-ancestry participants. The wGRS training set included N = 933 smokers recruited to the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction and Treatment clinical trial [NCT01314001]. The replication cohort included N = 196 smokers recruited to the Quit 2 Live clinical trial [NCT01836276]. Comparisons between the two CYP2A6 phenotypes and with fractional clearance were made in a laboratory-based pharmacokinetic study (N = 92 participants). In both the training and replication sets, the wGRS, which included seven CYP2A6 variants, explained 33.8% (P < 0.001) of the variance in NMR, providing improved predictive power to the NMR phenotype when compared with other CYP2A6 gene scoring approaches.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. However, it is unknown whether genetic predisposition to VTE is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis following vaccination. METHODS: Using data from the UK Biobank, which contains in-depth genotyping and linked vaccination and health outcomes information, we generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) using 299 genetic variants. We prospectively assessed associations between PRS and incident VTE immediately after first- and the second-dose vaccination and among historical unvaccinated cohorts during the pre- and early pandemic. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for PRS-VTE associations using Cox models. RESULTS: Of 359 310 individuals receiving one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 160 327 (44.6%) were males, and the mean age at the vaccination date was 69.05 (standard deviation [SD] 8.04) years. After 28- and 90-days' follow-up, 88 and 299 individuals developed VTE, respectively, equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.08) and 0.92 (0.82-1.04) per 100 000 person-days. The PRS was significantly associated with a higher risk of VTE (HR per 1 SD increase in PRS, 1.41 (1.15-1.73) in 28 days and 1.36 (1.22-1.52) in 90 days). Similar associations were found in the historical unvaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of genetic susceptibility with post-COVID-19-vaccination VTE is similar to that seen in historical data. Additionally, the observed PRS-VTE associations were equivalent for adenovirus- and mRNA-based vaccines. These findings suggest that, at the population level, the VTE that occurred after the COVID-19 vaccination has a similar genetic etiology to the conventional VTE.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a common autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in three known genes. DNA-based cascade testing is recommended by UK guidelines to identify affected relatives; however, about 60% of patients are mutation-negative. We assessed the hypothesis that familial hypercholesterolaemia can also be caused by an accumulation of common small-effect LDL-C-raising alleles. METHODS: In November, 2011, we assembled a sample of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia from three UK-based sources and compared them with a healthy control sample from the UK Whitehall II (WHII) study. We also studied patients from a Belgian lipid clinic (Hôpital de Jolimont, Haine St-Paul, Belgium) for validation analyses. We genotyped participants for 12 common LDL-C-raising alleles identified by the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium and constructed a weighted LDL-C-raising gene score. We compared the gene score distribution among patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia with no confirmed mutation, those with an identified mutation, and controls from WHII. FINDINGS: We recruited 321 mutation-negative UK patients (451 Belgian), 319 mutation-positive UK patients (273 Belgian), and 3020 controls from WHII. The mean weighted LDL-C gene score of the WHII participants (0.90 [SD 0.23]) was strongly associated with LDL-C concentration (p=1.4 x 10(-77); R(2)=0.11). Mutation-negative UK patients had a significantly higher mean weighted LDL-C score (1.0 [SD 0.21]) than did WHII controls (p=4.5 x 10(-16)), as did the mutation-negative Belgian patients (0.99 [0.19]; p=5.2 x 10(-20)). The score was also higher in UK (0.95 [0.20]; p=1.6 x 10(-5)) and Belgian (0.92 [0.20]; p=0.04) mutation-positive patients than in WHII controls. 167 (52%) of 321 mutation-negative UK patients had a score within the top three deciles of the WHII weighted LDL-C gene score distribution, and only 35 (11%) fell within the lowest three deciles. INTERPRETATION: In a substantial proportion of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia without a known mutation, their raised LDL-C concentrations might have a polygenic cause, which could compromise the efficiency of cascade testing. In patients with a detected mutation, a substantial polygenic contribution might add to the variable penetrance of the disease.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to calculate an individual's risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), called a genetic risk score (GRS). We investigated whether GRS can identify individuals with clinically relevant neoplasms in a screening colonoscopy population. METHODS: We derived a GRS based on 48 SNPs associated with CRC, identified in a comprehensive literature search. We obtained genetic data from 1043 participants (50-79 years old) in a screening colonoscopy study in Germany, recruited from 2005 through 2013 (294 with advanced neoplasms, 249 with non-advanced adenoma (NAAs), and 500 without neoplasms). Each participant was assigned a GRS by aggregating their risk alleles (0, 1, or 2). Risk of advanced neoplasms and NAA according to GRS was calculated by multiple logistic regression. Risk advancement periods were calculated. We replicated our findings using data from a subset of the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. RESULTS: An increased GRS was associated with higher prevalence of advanced neoplasms, but not NAAs. Participants in the middle and upper tertiles of GRS had a 2.2-fold and 2.7-fold increase in risk, respectively, of advanced neoplasms compared to those in the lower tertile. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.57) for NAA in the middle tertile and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.70-1.55) for NAA in the upper tertile. The ORs were largest for proximal advanced neoplasms for participants in the middle tertile (OR, 3.55; 95% CI 1.85-6.82) and the upper tertile (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.84-7.10). The risk advancement period for medium vs low GRS was 13.4 years (95% CI 4.8-22.0) and for high vs low GRS was 17.5 years (95% CI, 7.8-27.3). CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of participants in a CRC screening study in Germany, an increased GRS (based on CRC-associated SNPs) was associated with increased prevalence of advanced neoplasms. These findings might be used in defining risk-adapted screening ages.",

DESIGN: Analysis of genotype, PCa status, and age to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diagnosis. These polymorphisms were incorporated into a survival analysis to estimate their effects on age at diagnosis of aggressive PCa (that is, not eligible for surveillance according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines; any of Gleason score ≥7, stage T3-T4, PSA (prostate specific antigen) concentration ≥10 ng/L, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis). The resulting polygenic hazard score is an assessment of individual genetic risk. The final model was applied to an independent dataset containing genotype and PSA screening data.

In this study, we investigated the predictive ability of CAC GRS for CAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the association of CAC GRSs with CAD and coronary calcification among the participants in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health study (LURIC) ( RESULTS: CAC GRS was significantly associated with CAD in LURIC (OR=1.41, 95 % CI [1.28-1.55]), TVS (OR=1.79, 95 % CI [1.05-3.21]) as well as in TSDS (OR=4.20, 95 % CI [1.74-10.52]). CAC GRS showed strong association with calcification areas in left (OR=1.78, 95 % CI [1.16-2.74]) and right (OR=1.71, 95 % CI [1.98-2.67]) coronary arteries. There was statistically significant added predictive value of the CAC GRS for CAD over the used traditional CVD risk factors (AUC 0.734 vs 0.717, p-value = 0.02). Furthermore, CAC GRS improved the prediction accuracy for CAD when combined with metaGRS. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that CAC GRS is a new risk marker for CAD in three European cohorts, with added predictive value over the traditional CVD risk factors.",

Here, we set out to construct polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for longevity and to investigate the functions of longevity-associated variants. Using a cohort of centenarians with maintained cognitive health (N = 343), a population-matched cohort of older adults from 5 cohorts (N = 2905), and summary statistics data from genome-wide association studies on parental longevity, we constructed a PRS including 330 variants that significantly discriminated between centenarians and older adults. This PRS was also associated with longer survival in an independent sample of younger individuals (p = .02), leading up to a 4-year difference in survival based on common genetic factors only. We show that this PRS was, in part, able to compensate for the deleterious effect of the APOE-ε4 allele. Using an integrative framework, we annotated the 330 variants included in this PRS by the genes they associate with. We find that they are enriched with genes associated with cellular differentiation, developmental processes, and cellular response to stress. Together, our results indicate that an extended human life span is, in part, the result of a constellation of variants each exerting small advantageous effects on aging-related biological mechanisms that maintain overall health and decrease the risk of age-related diseases.",

Despite this high incidence, there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of this disease, and no medical therapy is available for this disease. We aimed to elucidate the genetic basis of MVP in order to better understand this complex disorder. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies that included 4884 cases and 434 649 controls. We identified 14 loci associated with MVP in our primary analysis and 2 additional loci associated with a subset of the samples that additionally underwent mitral valve surgery. Integration of epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic data identified candidate MVP genes including LMCD1, SPTBN1, LTBP2, TGFB2, NMB, and ALPK3. We created a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MVP and showed an improved MVP risk prediction beyond age, sex, and clinical risk factors. CONCLUSION: We identified 14 genetic loci that are associated with MVP. Multiple analyses identified candidate genes including two transforming growth factor-β signalling molecules and spectrin β. We present the first PRS for MVP that could eventually aid risk stratification of patients for MVP screening in a clinical setting. These findings advance our understanding of this common valvular heart disease and may reveal novel therapeutic targets for intervention.",

We investigated associations of \"restricted\" and genome-wide PRSs with CHD in three major racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. The eMERGE cohort (mean age 48 ± 14 years, 58% female) included 45,645 EA, 7,597 AA, and 2,493 HE individuals. We assessed two restricted PRSs (PRSTikkanen and PRSTada; 28 and 50 variants, respectively) and two genome-wide PRSs (PRSmetaGRS and PRSLDPred; 1.7 M and 6.6 M variants, respectively) derived from EA cohorts. Over a median follow-up of 11.1 years, 2,652 incident CHD events occurred. Hazard and odds ratios for the association of PRSs with CHD were similar in EA and HE cohorts but lower in AA cohorts. Genome-wide PRSs were more strongly associated with CHD than restricted PRSs were. PRSmetaGRS, the best performing PRS, was associated with CHD in all three cohorts; hazard ratios (95% CI) per 1 SD increase were 1.53 (1.46-1.60), 1.53 (1.23-1.90), and 1.27 (1.13-1.43) for incident CHD in EA, HE, and AA individuals, respectively. The hazard ratios were comparable in the EA and HE cohorts (pinteraction = 0.77) but were significantly attenuated in AA individuals (pinteraction= 2.9 × 10-3). These results highlight the potential clinical utility of PRSs for CHD as well as the need to assemble diverse cohorts to generate ancestry- and ethnicity PRSs.",

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Asian-specific models using a Japanese population-based prospective study. METHODS: We derived 31 genome-wide PRSs using a genome-wide association study of CRC from the Biobank Japan and selected the best-performing PRS with the highest C-index in development case-cohort, including 200 incident cases. In evaluation case-cohort, including 693 incident cases, we assessed the discrimination accuracy (C-index, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification improvement (NRI)) of lifestyle, PRS, and combined models using 5-fold cross-validation methods and estimated 10-year absolute risk. RESULTS: Of the 31 derived PRSs, the PRS aggregating 104,677 variant risks performed best in the development case-cohort. The men and women in the highest quintiles of the PRS had an approximately three-fold and two-fold higher risk of CRC, respectively, than those in the lowest in the evaluation case-cohort. Meanwhile, the association of lifestyle factors with CRC risk was observed only in men. Incorporating the PRS into a lifestyle model improved the C-index from 0.64 to 0.66 for men and from 0.61 to 0.63 for women. The IDI and NRI values supported this improvement. The 10-year absolute risk was 3.3 % and 1.6 % for high-risk men and women, respectively, and 0.5 % for both low-risk men and women. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the CRC risk prediction model utilizing genome-wide PRS for Asians is valuable; however, further improvement is needed before clinical implementation.",

This study evaluates the association of diabetes onset age and duration with incident arrhythmias and assesses modiﬁcations by the genetic predisposition to atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: We included 457,151 participants from the UK Biobank study. Multivariable Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for the association between diabetes status, genetic predisposition, and risk of incident arrhythmias. The polygenic risk score (PRS) for AF comprised 142 single-nucleotide variants. RESULTS: Over 12 years of follow-up, we documented 23,518 AF, 9079 bradyarrhythmia, 9280 conduction system diseases, 3358 supraventricular arrhythmias, and 3095 ventricular arrhythmias. Compared with non-diabetes, the risks of AF increased by 19%, 25%, and 36% for those with diabetes durations <5, 5-9, and ≥10 years, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, with the increase in diabetes onset age, the HRs of outcomes were gradually attenuated. The multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) of diabetes for AF were 1.46 (1.24-1.71) in early middle age (<55 years), 1.21 (1.12-1.30) in late middle age (55-64 years), and 1.15 (1.06-1.24) in the elderly population (≥65 years). A significant interaction between diabetes status and AF-PRS for incident AF was observed (P for interaction <0.001). The same trends were observed for the other arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with higher risks of incident arrhythmias, and younger age at onset of diabetes was significantly associated with higher risk of subsequent arrhythmias.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis's transient activity in infancy, i.e, minipuberty, is considered crucial for male reproductive function. Historically, minipuberty has been considered a passive response triggered by the withdrawal of placental steroids at birth. However, given its potential link to adult reproductive function, we hypothesize that minipuberty is a partially genetically regulated process, suggesting a link between the genetic architecture of reproductive hormone concentrations across lifespan. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of UK Biobank Study-based polygenic scores (PGS) of adult total testosterone (T) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations with trajectories of reproductive hormones concentrations in male infants. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal birth cohort (The COPENHAGEN Minipuberty Study, 2016-2018, ClinTrial: NCT02784184). Individual PGSs in male infants derived from published literature were calculated for total T and SHBG. The associations with mean SD scores (SDS) of reproductive hormone concentrations in infancy were tested. SETTING: Population-based. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, male, term, singleton newborns were followed with repeated clinical examinations including blood sampling during a 1-year follow-up (n = 109). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Circulating reproductive hormone concentrations. RESULTS: T-PGSadult were significant associated with mean T-SDSinfancy, mean SHBG-SDSinfancy, and mean LH-SDSinfancy (P = .02, <.001 and .03, with r2 = 0.05, 0.21 and 0.04, respectively). SHBG-PGSadult was significantly associated with mean SHBG-SDSinfancy (P < .001, r2 = 0.18). T-PGSadult explained 5% and 21% of the phenotypic variation in infancy of mean T-SDSinfancy and SHBG-SDSinfancy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the genetic architecture underlying total T and SHBG in adults also associates with hormone concentrations and their trajectories during infancy.",

METHODS: We used summary-level genetic data for smoking initiation, smoking intensity (cigarettes per day [CPD]), intraocular pressure (IOP), vertical cup-disc ratio, and open-angle glaucoma (OAG) to estimate global genetic correlations (rg) and perform two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) experiments that explored relations between traits. Finally, we examined associations between smoking genetic risk scores (GRS) and smoking traits with measured IOP and OAG in Rotterdam Study participants. RESULTS: We identified weak inverse rg between smoking- and glaucoma-related traits that were insignificant after Bonferroni correction. However, MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted smoking initiation was associated with lower IOP (-0.18 mm Hg per SD, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.30 to -0.06, P = 0.003). Furthermore, genetically predicted smoking intensity was associated with decreased OAG risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74 per SD, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.90, P = 0.002). In the Rotterdam Study, the smoking initiation GRS was associated with lower IOP (-0.09 mm Hg per SD, 95% CI = -0.17 to -0.01, P = 0.04) and lower odds of OAG (OR = 0.84 per SD, 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.98, P = 0.02) in multivariable-adjusted analyses. In contrast, neither smoking history nor CPD was associated with IOP (P ≥ 0.38) or OAG (P ≥ 0.54). Associations between the smoking intensity GRS and glaucoma traits were null (P ≥ 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: MR experiments and GRS generated from Rotterdam Study participants support an inverse relationship between smoking and glaucoma. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the genetic drivers of the inverse relationship between smoking and glaucoma could yield new insights into glaucoma pathophysiology.",

      "abstract": "More than 200 genetic variants have been independently associated with prostate cancer risk. Studies among farmers have also observed increased prostate cancer risk associated with exposure to specific organophosphate (fonofos, terbufos, malathion, dimethoate) and organochlorine (aldrin, chlordane) insecticides. We examined the joint associations between these pesticides, established prostate cancer loci, and prostate cancer risk among 1,162 cases (588 aggressive) and 2,206 frequency-matched controls nested in the Agricultural Health Study cohort. History of lifetime pesticide use was combined with a polygenic risk score (PRS) generated using 256 established prostate cancer risk variants. Logistic regression models estimated the joint associations of the pesticides, the PRS, and the 256 individual genetic variants with risk of total and aggressive prostate cancer. Likelihood ratio tests assessed multiplicative interaction. We observed interaction between ever use of fonofos and the PRS in relation to total and aggressive prostate cancer risk. Compared to the reference group (never use, PRS < median), men with ever use of fonofos and PRS > median had elevated risks of total (OR 1.35 [1.06-1.73], p-interaction = 0.03) and aggressive (OR 1.49 [1.09-2.04], p-interaction = 0.19) prostate cancer. There was also suggestion of interaction between pesticides and individual genetic variants occurring in regions associated with DNA damage response (CDH3, EMSY genes) and with variants related to altered androgen receptor-driven transcriptional programs critical for prostate cancer. Our study provides evidence that men with greater genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer may be at higher risk if they are also exposed to pesticides and suggests potential mechanisms by which pesticides may increase prostate cancer risk.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is in part genetically determined. Aging is accentuated in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH). It is unknown whether genetic CAD event prediction in PLWH is improved by applying individual polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and by considering genetic variants associated with successful aging and longevity. METHODS: In the Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants of self-reported European descent, we determined univariable and multivariable odds ratios (ORs) for CAD events, based on traditional CAD risk factors, adverse antiretroviral exposures, and different validated genome-wide PRSs. PRSs were built from CAD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), longevity-associated SNPs, or both. RESULTS: We included 269 patients with CAD events between 2000 and 2017 (median age, 54 years; 87% male; 82% with suppressed HIV RNA) and 567 event-free controls. Clinical (ie, traditional and HIV-related) risk factors and PRSs, built from CAD-associated SNPs, longevity-associated SNPs, or both, each contributed independently to CAD events (P < .001). Participants with the most unfavorable clinical risk factor profile (top quintile) had an adjusted CAD-OR of 17.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.19-38.76), compared with participants in the bottom quintile. Participants with the most unfavorable CAD-PRSs (top quintile) had an adjusted CAD-OR of 3.17 (95% CI, 1.74-5.79), compared with the bottom quintile. After adding longevity-associated SNPs to the CAD-PRS, participants with the most unfavorable genetic background (top quintile) had an adjusted CAD-OR of 3.67 (95% CI, 2.00-6.73), compared with the bottom quintile. CONCLUSIONS: In Swiss PLWH, CAD prediction based on traditional and HIV-related risk factors was superior to genetic CAD prediction based on longevity- and CAD-associated PRS. Combining traditional, HIV-related, and genetic risk factors provided the most powerful CAD prediction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the underlying genetic risk of elevated blood pressure (BP) determine an individual's composite risk of developing adverse cardiovascular events. We sought to evaluate the relative contributions of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors to the development of adverse cardiovascular events in the context of varying BP genetic risk profiles. METHODS: Genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) was computed using multiancestry genome-wide association estimates among US adults who underwent whole-genome sequencing in the Trans-Omics for Precision program. Individuals were stratified into high, intermediate, and low genetic risk groups (>80th, 20-80th, and <20th centiles of systolic BP [SBP] PRS). Based on the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations, participants were stratified into low and high (10 year-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk: <10% or ≥10%) cardiovascular risk factor profile groups. The primary study outcome was incident cardiovascular event (composite of incident heart failure, incident stroke, and incident coronary heart disease). RESULTS: Among 21 897 US adults (median age: 56 years; 56.0% women; 35.8% non-White race/ethnicity), 1 SD increase in the SBP PRS, computed using 1.08 million variants, was associated with SBP (β: 4.39 [95% CI, 4.13-4.65]) and hypertension (odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.46-1.55]), respectively. This association was robustly seen across racial/ethnic groups. Each SD increase in SBP PRS was associated with a higher risk of the incident CVD (multivariable-adjusted hazards ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.10]) after controlling for ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations risk scores. Among individuals with a high SBP PRS, low atherosclerotic CVD risk was associated with a 58% lower hazard for incident CVD (multivariable-adjusted hazards ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.36-0.50]) compared to those with high atherosclerotic CVD risk. A similar pattern was noted in intermediate and low genetic risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a multiancestry cohort of >21 000 US adults, genome-wide SBP PRS was associated with BP traits and adverse cardiovascular events. Adequate control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors may reduce the predisposition to adverse cardiovascular events among those with a high SBP PRS.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Interest in targeted screening programmes for atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased, yet the role of genetics in identifying patients at highest risk of developing AF is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 36,662 subjects without prior AF were analyzed from four TIMI trials. Subjects were divided into quintiles using a validated polygenic risk score (PRS) for AF. Clinical risk for AF was calculated using the CHARGE-AF model. Kaplan-Meier event rates, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), C-indices, and net reclassification improvement were used to determine if the addition of the PRS improved prediction compared with clinical risk and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Over 2.3 years, 1018 new AF cases developed. AF PRS predicted a significant risk gradient for AF with a 40% increased risk per 1-SD increase in PRS [HR: 1.40 (1.32-1.49); P < 0.001]. Those with high AF PRS (top 20%) were more than two-fold more likely to develop AF [HR 2.45 (1.99-3.03), P < 0.001] compared with low PRS (bottom 20%). Furthermore, PRS provided an additional gradient of risk stratification on top of the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score, ranging from a 3-year incidence of 1.3% in patients with low clinical and genetic risk to 8.7% in patients with high clinical and genetic risk. The subgroup of patients with high clinical risk, high PRS, and elevated NT-proBNP had an AF risk of 16.7% over 3 years. The C-index with the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score alone was 0.65, which improved to 0.67 (P < 0.001) with the addition of NT-proBNP, and increased further to 0.70 (P < 0.001) with the addition of the PRS. CONCLUSION: In patients with cardiovascular conditions, AF PRS is a strong independent predictor of incident AF that provides complementary predictive value when added to a validated clinical risk score and NT-proBNP.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 356,621 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank of White British ancestry with no prior diagnosis of T2D and normal HbA RESULTS: In the study population, 7,513 had incident T2D. The C-statistics for the PGS, PXS, and CRS models were 0.709, 0.762, and 0.839, respectively. Individuals in the top 10% of PGS, PXS, and CRS had 2.00-, 5.90-, and 9.97-fold greater risk, respectively, compared to the remaining population. Addition of PGS and PXS to CRS improved T2D classification accuracy, with a continuous net reclassification index of 15.2% and 30.1% for cases, respectively, and 7.3% and 16.9% for controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For T2D, the PXS provides modest incremental predictive value over established clinical risk factors. However, the concept of PXS merits further consideration in T2D risk stratification and is likely to be useful in other chronic disease risk prediction models.",

This study in a patient biobank examined associations of a BMI polygenic risk score (PRS), and its interactions with lifestyle risk factors, with clinically measured BMI and clinical phenotypes. METHODS: The Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank is a hospital-based cohort with electronic health record, genetic, and lifestyle data. A PRS for obesity was generated using 97 genetic variants for BMI. An obesity lifestyle risk index using survey responses to obesogenic lifestyle risk factors (alcohol, education, exercise, sleep, smoking, and shift work) was used to dichotomize the cohort into high and low obesogenic index based on the population median. Height and weight were measured at a clinical visit. Multivariable linear cross-sectional associations of the PRS with BMI and interactions with the obesity lifestyle risk index were conducted. In phenome-wide association analyses (PheWAS), similar logistic models were conducted for 675 disease outcomes derived from billing codes. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand five hundred eleven patients were analyzed (53.1% female; age 60.0 years; BMI 28.3 kg/m CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based clinical biobank, obesity risk conferred by common genetic variants was associated with elevated BMI and this risk was attenuated by a healthier patient lifestyle.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of combining the Clinical Classification (CC) and the Three Continent age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Consortium Severity Scale (3CACSS) for classification of AMD. METHODS: In two independent cross-sectional datasets of our population-based AugUR study (Altersbezogene Untersuchungen zur Gesundheit der Universität Regensburg), we graded AMD via color fundus images applying two established classification systems (CC and 3CACSS). We calculated the genetic risk score (GRS) across 50 previously identified variants for late AMD, its association via logistic regression, and area under the curve (AUC) for each AMD stage. RESULTS: We analyzed 2188 persons aged 70 to 95 years. When comparing the two classification systems, we found a distinct pattern: CC \"age-related changes\" and CC \"early AMD\" distinguished individuals with 3CACSS \"no AMD\"; 3CACSS \"mild/moderate/severe early AMD\" stages, and distinguished CC \"intermediate AMD\". This suggested a 7-step scale combining the 2 systems: (i) \"no AMD\", (ii) \"age-related changes\", (iii) \"very early AMD\", (i.e. CC \"early\"), (iv) \"mild early AMD\", (v) \"moderate early AMD\", (vi) \"severe early AMD\", and (vii) \"late AMD\". GRS association and diagnostic accuracy increased stepwise by increased AMD severity in the 7-step scale and by increased restriction of controls (e.g. for CC \"no AMD without age-related changes\": AUC = 55.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 51.6, 58.6, AUC = 62.3%, 95% CI = 59.1, 65.6, AUC = 63.8%, 95% CI = 59.3, 68.3, AUC = 78.1%, 95% CI = 73.6, 82.5, AUC = 82.2%, 95% CI = 78.4, 86.0, and AUC = 79.2%, 95% CI = 75.4, 83.0). A stepwise increase was also observed by increased drusen size and area. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of a 7-step scale is supported by our clinical and GRS data. This harmonization and full data integration provides an immediate simplification over using either CC or 3CACSS and helps to sharpen the control group.",

We hypothesize that GRS is a valid tool for risk assessment of most common cancers. METHODS: Utilizing genotype and phenotype data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), we tested 11 cancer-specific GRSs (bladder, breast, colorectal, glioma, lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and thyroid cancer) for association with the respective cancer type. Cancer-specific GRSs were calculated, for the first time in these cohorts, based on previously published risk-associated SNPs using the Caucasian subjects in these two cohorts. RESULTS: Mean cancer-specific GRS in the population controls of eMERGE approximated the expected value of 1.00 (between 0.98 and 1.02) for all 11 types of cancer. Mean cancer-specific GRS was consistently higher in respective cancer patients than controls for all 11 types of cancer (P < 0.05). When subjects were categorized into low-, average-, and high-risk groups based on cancer-specific GRS (<0.5, 0.5-1.5, and >1.5, respectively), significant dose-response associations of higher cancer-specific GRS with higher OR of respective type of cancer were found for nine types of cancer (P CONCLUSION: Validity of GRS for predicting cancer risk is demonstrated for most types of cancer.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polygenic prediction studies in continental Africans are scarce. Africa's genetic and environmental diversity pose a challenge that limits the generalizability of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for body mass index (BMI) within the continent. Studies to understand the factors that affect PRS variability within Africa are required. METHODS: Using the first multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for BMI involving continental Africans, we derived a multi-ancestry PRS and compared its performance to a European ancestry-specific PRS in continental Africans (AWI-Gen study) and a European cohort (Estonian Biobank). We then evaluated the factors affecting the performance of the PRS in Africans which included fine-mapping resolution, allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and PRS-environment interactions. RESULTS: Polygenic prediction of BMI in continental Africans is poor compared to that in European ancestry individuals. However, we show that the multi-ancestry PRS is more predictive than the European ancestry-specific PRS due to its improved fine-mapping resolution. We noted regional variation in polygenic prediction across Africa's East, South, and West regions, which was driven by a complex interplay of the PRS with environmental factors, such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the role of gene-environment interactions in PRS prediction variability in Africa. PRS methods that correct for these interactions, coupled with the increased representation of Africans in GWAS, may improve PRS prediction in Africa.",

We evaluated the performance of existing PRSs trained in European ancestry populations among women of African ancestry. METHODS: We assembled genotype data for women of African ancestry, including 9241 case subjects and 10 193 control subjects. We evaluated associations of 179- and 313-variant PRSs with overall and subtype-specific BC risk. PRS discriminatory accuracy was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also evaluated a recalibrated PRS, replacing the index variant with variants in each region that better captured risk in women of African ancestry and estimated lifetime absolute risk of BC in African Americans by PRS category. RESULTS: For overall BC, the odds ratio per SD of the 313-variant PRS (PRS313) was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.31), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.571 (95% CI = 0.562 to 0.579). Compared with women with average risk (40th-60th PRS percentile), women in the top decile of PRS313 had a 1.54-fold increased risk (95% CI = 1.38-fold to 1.72-fold). By age 85 years, the absolute risk of overall BC was 19.6% for African American women in the top 1% of PRS313 and 6.7% for those in the lowest 1%.

We aimed to examine whether common risk factors, mammographic features, and breast cancer risk prediction scores of a woman were associated with breast cancer risk for her sisters. METHODS: We included 53 051 women from the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA) study. Established risk factors were derived using self-reported questionnaires, mammograms, and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. Using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register, we identified 32 198 sisters of the KARMA women (including 5352 KARMA participants and 26 846 nonparticipants). Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of breast cancer for both women and their sisters, respectively. RESULTS: A higher breast cancer polygenic risk score, a history of benign breast disease, and higher breast density in women were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for both women and their sisters. No statistically significant association was observed between breast microcalcifications and masses in women and breast cancer risk for their sisters. Furthermore, higher breast cancer risk scores in women were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for their sisters. Specifically, the hazard ratios for breast cancer per 1 standard deviation increase in age-adjusted KARMA, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and Tyrer-Cuzick risk scores were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.27), 1.23 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.35), and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.11 to 1.32), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the presence, severity, impact and associated factors for motor complications in PD. METHODS: Analysis of three large prospective cohort studies of recent-onset PD patients followed for up to 12 years. The MDS-UPDRS part 4 assessed motor complications and multivariable logistic regression tested for associations. Genetic risk score (GRS) for Parkinson's was calculated from 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: 3343 cases were included (64.7% male). Off periods affected 35.0% (95% CI 33.0, 37.0) at 4-6 years and 59.0% (55.6, 62.3) at 8-10 years. Dyskinesia affected 18.5% (95% CI 16.9, 20.2) at 4-6 years and 42.1% (38.7, 45.5) at 8-10 years. Dystonia affected 13.4% (12.1, 14.9) at 4-6 years and 22.8% (20.1, 25.9) at 8-10 years. Off periods consistently caused greater functional impact than dyskinesia. Motor complications were more common among those with higher drug doses, younger age at diagnosis, female gender, and greater dopaminergic responsiveness (in challenge tests), with associations emerging 2-4 years post-diagnosis. Higher Parkinson's GRS was associated with early dyskinesia (0.026 ≤ P ≤ 0.050 from 2 to 6 years). CONCLUSIONS: Off periods are more common and cause greater functional impairment than dyskinesia. We confirm previously reported associations between motor complications with several demographic and medication factors. Greater dopaminergic responsiveness and a higher genetic risk score are two novel and significant independent risk factors for the development of motor complications.",

Among carriers of a monogenic risk variant, we estimate substantial gradients in disease risk based on polygenic background - the probability of disease by age 75 years ranged from 17% to 78% for coronary artery disease, 13% to 76% for breast cancer, and 11% to 80% for colon cancer. We propose that accounting for polygenic background is likely to increase accuracy of risk estimation for individuals who inherit a monogenic risk variant.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC; patients < 50 years old) has been rising rapidly, whereas the EOCRC genetic susceptibility remains incompletely investigated. Here, we aimed to systematically identify specific susceptible genetic variants for EOCRC. METHODS: Two parallel GWASs were conducted in 17,789 CRC cases (including 1490 EOCRC cases) and 19,951 healthy controls. A polygenic risk score (PRS) model was built based on identified EOCRC-specific susceptibility variants by using the UK Biobank cohort. We also interpreted the potential biological mechanisms of the prioritized risk variant. RESULTS: We identified 49 independent susceptibility loci that were significantly associated with the susceptibility to EOCRC and the diagnosed age of CRC (both P < 5.0×10 CONCLUSIONS: These findings will broaden the understanding of the etiology of EOCRC and may facilitate the early screening and individualized prevention.",

We established ExPRSs for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions.

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are one way to aggregate the effects of a large number of genetic variants upon the risk for a disease like PD in a single quantity. However, reassessment of the performance of a given PRS in independent data sets is a precondition for establishing the PRS as a valid tool to this end. We studied a previously proposed PRS for PD in a separate genetic data set, comprising 1914 PD cases and 4464 controls, and were able to replicate its ability to differentiate between cases and controls. We also assessed theoretically the prognostic value of the PD-PRS, i.e., its ability to predict the development of PD in later life for healthy individuals. As it turned out, the PD-PRS alone can be expected to perform poorly in this regard. Therefore, we conclude that the PD-PRS could serve as an important research tool, but that meaningful PRS-based prognosis of PD at an individual level is not feasible.",

      "abstract": "To date, the combined effect of polygenic risk score (PRS) and prostate health index (phi) on PCa diagnosis in men undergoing prostate biopsy has never been investigated. A total of 3166 patients who underwent initial prostate biopsy in three tertiary medical centers from August 2013 to March 2019 were included. PRS was calculated on the basis of the genotype of 102 reported East-Asian-specific risk variants. It was then evaluated in the univariable or multivariable logistic regression models that were internally validated using repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Discriminative performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) index. Compared with men in the first quintile of age and family history adjusted PRS, those in the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles were 1.86 (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-2.56), 2.07 (95%CI: 1.50-2.84), 3.26 (95%CI: 2.36-4.48), and 5.06 (95%CI: 3.68-6.97) times as likely to develop PCa (all p < 0.001). Adjustment for other clinical parameters yielded similar results. Among patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 2-10 ng/mL or 2-20 ng/mL, PRS still had an observable ability to differentiate PCa in the group of prostate health index (phi) at 27-36 (Ptrend < 0.05) or >36 (Ptrend ≤ 0.001). Notably, men with moderate phi (27-36) but highest PRS (top 20% percentile) would have a comparable risk of PCa (positive rate: 26.7% or 31.3%) than men with high phi (>36) but lowest PRS (bottom 20% percentile positive rate: 27.4% or 34.2%). The combined model of PRS, phi, and other clinical risk factors provided significantly better performance (AUC: 0.904, 95%CI: 0.887-0.921) than models without PRS. Adding PRS to clinical risk models could provide significant net benefit (NRI, from 8.6% to 27.6%), especially in those early onset patients (NRI, from 29.2% to 44.9%). PRS may provide additional predictive value over phi for PCa. The combination of PRS and phi that effectively captured both clinical and genetic PCa risk is clinically practical, even in patients with gray-zone PSA.",

Whether statin-induced low-density lipoprotein reduction increases risk of intracerebral haemorrhage has been debated for almost two decades. Here, we explored whether genetically predicted on-statin low-density lipoprotein response is associated with intracerebral haemorrhage risk using Mendelian randomization. Using genomic data from randomized trials, we derived a polygenic score from 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms of on-statin low-density lipoprotein response and tested it in the population-based UK Biobank. We extracted statin drug and dose information from primary care data on a subset of 225 195 UK Biobank participants covering a period of 29 years. We validated the effects of the genetic score on longitudinal low-density lipoprotein measurements with generalized mixed models and explored associations with incident intracerebral haemorrhage using Cox regression analysis. Statins were prescribed at least once to 75 973 (31%) of the study participants (mean 57 years, 55% females). Among statin users, mean low-density lipoprotein decreased by 3.45 mg/dl per year [95% confidence interval (CI): (-3.47, -3.42)] over follow-up. A higher genetic score of statin response [1 standard deviation (SD) increment] was associated with significant additional reductions in low-density lipoprotein levels [-0.05 mg/dl per year, (-0.07, -0.02)], showed concordant lipidomic effects on other lipid traits as statin use and was associated with a lower risk for incident myocardial infarction [hazard ratio per SD increment 0.98 95% CI (0.96, 0.99)] and peripheral artery disease [hazard ratio per SD increment 0.93 95% CI (0.87, 0.99)]. Over a 11-year follow-up period, a higher genetically predicted statin response among statin users was associated with higher intracerebral haemorrhage risk in a model adjusting for statin dose [hazard ratio per SD increment 1.16, 95% CI (1.05, 1.28)]. On the contrary, there was no association with intracerebral haemorrhage risk among statin non-users (P = 0.89). These results provide further support for the hypothesis that statin-induced low-density lipoprotein reduction may be causally associated with intracerebral haemorrhage risk. While the net benefit of statins for preventing vascular disease is well-established, these results provide insights about the personalized response to statin intake and the role of pharmacological low-density lipoprotein lowering in the pathogenesis of intracerebral haemorrhage.",

In recent years, new generation antidepressant medicines have become very widely prescribed. While these medicines are efficacious, side effects are common and frequently result in discontinuation of treatment. Compared with specific pharmacological properties of the different medications, the relevance of individual vulnerability is understudied. METHODS: We used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study to gain insights into the aetiology and genetic risk factors to antidepressant side effects. To this end, we employed structural equation modelling, polygenic risk scoring and regressions. RESULTS: Here we show that participants reporting a specific side effect for one antidepressant are more likely to report the same side effect for other antidepressants, suggesting the presence of shared individual or pharmacological factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression associated with side effects that overlapped with depressive symptoms, including suicidality and anxiety. Body Mass Index PRS are strongly associated with weight gain from all medications. PRS for headaches are associated with headaches from sertraline. Insomnia PRS show some evidence of predicting insomnia from amitriptyline and escitalopram. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a set of common factors underlying the risk for antidepressant side effects. These factors seem to be partly explained by genetic liability related to depression severity and the nature of the side effect. Future studies on the genetic aetiology of side effects will enable insights into their underlying mechanisms and the possibility of risk stratification and prophylaxis strategies.",

However, prospective calibration of absolute risk prediction models, based on a PRS or PRS combined with lifestyle, clinical and environmental factors, in Asian women is limited. METHODS: We consider several PRSs trained using European and/or Asian GWAS. For each PRS, we evaluate the discrimination and calibration of three absolute risk models among 41 031 women from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study (KCPS)-II Biobank: (i) a model using incidence, mortality and risk factor distributions (reference inputs) among US women and European relative risks; (ii) a recalibrated model, using Korean reference but European relative risks; and (iii) a fully Korean-based model using Korean reference and relative risk estimates from KCPS. RESULTS: All Asian and European PRS improved discrimination over lifestyle, clinical and environmental (Qx) factors in Korean women. US-based absolute risk models overestimated the risks for women aged ≥50 years, and this overestimation was larger for models that only included PRS (expected-to-observed ratio E/O = 1.2 for women <50, E/O = 2.7 for women ≥50). Recalibrated and Korean-based risk models had better calibration in the large, although the risk in the highest decile was consistently overestimated. Absolute risk projections suggest that risk-reducing lifestyle changes would lead to larger absolute risk reductions among women at higher PRS.

As screening guidelines lower the recommended age of screening initiation, concerns including the burden on screening capacity and costs have been recognized, suggesting that an individualized approach may be warranted. We developed risk prediction models for early-onset CRC that incorporate an environmental risk score (ERS), including 16 lifestyle and environmental factors, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) of 141 variants. METHODS: Relying on risk score weights for ERS and PRS derived from studies of CRC at all ages, we evaluated risks for early-onset CRC in 3486 cases and 3890 controls aged younger than 50 years. Relative and absolute risks for early-onset CRC were assessed according to values of the ERS and PRS. The discriminatory performance of these scores was estimated using the covariate-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Increasing values of ERS and PRS were associated with increasing relative risks for early-onset CRC (odds ratio per SD of ERS = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08 to 1.20; odds ratio per SD of PRS = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.51 to 1.68), both contributing to case-control discrimination (area under the curve = 0.631, 95% CI = 0.615 to 0.647). Based on absolute risks, we can expect 26 excess cases per 10 000 men and 21 per 10 000 women among those scoring at the 90th percentile for both risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: Personal risk scores have the potential to identify individuals at differential relative and absolute risk for early-onset CRC.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) can be greatly reduced through screening. To aid in the development of screening strategies, we refined models designed to determine risk of CRC by incorporating information from common genetic susceptibility loci. METHODS: By using data collected from more than 12,000 participants in 6 studies performed from 1990 through 2011 in the United States and Germany, we developed risk determination models based on sex, age, family history, genetic risk score (number of risk alleles carried at 27 validated common CRC susceptibility loci), and history of endoscopic examinations. The model was validated using data collected from approximately 1800 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, conducted from 1993 through 2001 in the United States. RESULTS: We identified a CRC genetic risk score that independently predicted which patients in the training set would develop CRC. Compared with determination of risk based only on family history, adding the genetic risk score increased the discriminatory accuracy from 0.51 to 0.59 (P = .0028) for men and from 0.52 to 0.56 (P = .14) for women. We calculated age- and sex-specific 10-year CRC absolute risk estimates based on the number of risk alleles, family history, and history of endoscopic examinations. A model that included a genetic risk score better determined the recommended starting age for screening in subjects with and without family histories of CRC. The starting age for high-risk men (family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 90%) was 42 years, and for low-risk men (no family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 10%) was 52 years. For men with no family history and a high genetic risk score (90%), the starting age would be 47 years; this is an intermediate value that is 5 years earlier than it would be for men with a genetic risk score of 10%. Similar trends were observed in women. CONCLUSIONS: By incorporating information on CRC risk alleles, we created a model to determine the risk for CRC more accurately.

Herein, we evaluated the association of a PRS with CLL risk and its precursor, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). We assessed its validity and discriminative ability in an independent sample and evaluated effect modification and confounding by family history (FH) of hematological cancers. For discovery, we pooled genotype data on 41 representative SNPs from 1499 CLL and 2459 controls from the InterLymph Consortium. For validation, we used data from 1267 controls from Mayo Clinic and 201 CLL, 95 MBL, and 144 controls with a FH of CLL from the Genetic Epidemiology of CLL Consortium. We used odds ratios (ORs) to estimate disease associations with PRS and c-statistics to assess discriminatory accuracy. In InterLymph, the continuous PRS was strongly associated with CLL risk (OR, 2.49; ",
