# OmicsPred Page Templates

This directory contains HTML templates used for rendering **OmicsPred** data. These templates define the standard page structure for displaying genetic scores and platform information within the project.

## File Descriptions

- **`platforms.html`**: Template for the platform display page. Defines the skeleton for showing different omics data sources or experimental platforms.
- **`score_page.html`**: Template for the score details page. Defines the layout for displaying detailed information about a specific genetic score.

## Key Features
- **Tech Stack**: Integrates libraries such as React, MUI (Material UI), Chart.js, and Bootstrap, enabling high interactivity and rich data visualization.
- **SEO Optimization**: Pre-configured with keywords and descriptions tailored for the OmicsPred project.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The page body contains a `<div id="content"></div>` mount point, where content is typically dynamically populated by frontend assets (e.g., `/assets/index-*.js`).

## Project Integration
These templates ensure that PRS (Polygenic Risk Score) or omics data analysis results in this project are presented in a format consistent with OmicsPred standards.
