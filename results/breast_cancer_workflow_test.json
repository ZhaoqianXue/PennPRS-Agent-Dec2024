      "rationale": "Reasoning: Direct breast-cancer PRS models are abundant and trait-matched, so substitution is unnecessary. Evidence: In the provided direct-match shortlist, PGS000007 (invasive breast cancer; LASSO penalized regression) reports AUC=0.78 (R2=0.153) with multi-cohort training (n=10,444) and outperforms other highlighted direct models (e.g., PGS000332 AUC=0.75; PGS000015 AUC=0.69). Recommendation: Use PGS000007 as the primary direct-match PRS for breast cancer. Caveats: Confidence remains Moderate because calibration and deployment-relevant external validation details (especially across ancestries) are not provided in the context; most evidence appears EUR-centric, so portability may be reduced in non-EUR populations."

Evidence: Reported AUC=0.75 in EUR evaluation with LDpred and large variant set (~6.39M). Recommendation: Consider as a baseline comparator or if method/implementation constraints favor LDpred-style genome-wide scores. Caveats: Lower reported AUC than PGS000007 in the context and limited details on calibration and multi-ancestry performance."

Recommendation: Consider if you require a simpler, smaller-variant score and accept lower discrimination. Caveats: Lower discrimination than top candidate; performance may vary materially by ancestry and phenotyping definition."
