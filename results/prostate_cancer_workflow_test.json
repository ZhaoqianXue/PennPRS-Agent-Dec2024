      "rationale": "Reasoning: Direct PRS models for prostate cancer exist in sufficient quantity and include at least one model with unusually strong reported discrimination relative to typical PRS performance, supporting a direct high-quality recommendation.\nEvidence: In the provided context, 96 prostate-cancer PRS were found (25 after filtering). Top evaluated models include PGS000662 (AUC=0.961; 269 variants; derived from a trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis with multi-ancestry evaluation) and PGS001291 (AUC=0.970; snpnet; UK Biobank-trained with multi-ancestry evaluation). AUCs near ~0.96–0.97 are far above common complex-disease PRS baselines, indicating strong discriminatory signal in the reported evaluation.\nRecommendation: Use PGS000662 as the primary model because it is explicitly derived from a trans-ancestry meta-analysis and evaluated across multiple ancestries, which is generally preferable for broader transferability than a single-biobank development pipeline.\nCaveats: Confidence remains Moderate because very high AUCs can be influenced by study design (case–control enrichment, age structure), screening/diagnosis patterns, and evaluation choices; calibration and ancestry-stratified metrics are not provided in the context; and covariate reporting includes sex for a male-specific cancer, suggesting possible template/reporting artifacts that warrant review of the original PGS entry and publication before deployment."
