      "rationale": "Reasoning: Direct prostate cancer PRS are available, so transfer is unnecessary. However, the Step 1 decision outcome was forced to DIRECT_SUB_OPTIMAL in the provided context and the confidence was set to Low. Evidence: PGS Catalog search for 'Prostate cancer' returned 96 total scores; after filtering, 25 remained. Among top candidates, PGS001291 (snpnet; UKB training n=269,704; 948 variants) reports AUC 0.97011 and R² 0.40156 with multi-ancestry evaluation (AFR/EAS/EUR/SAS). Recommendation: Use PGS001291 as the baseline direct model for prostate cancer risk prediction in this context, while independently confirming phenotyping definition and avoiding overinterpretation of the unusually high AUC without protocol review. Caveats: High reported AUC may reflect study design/ascertainment or non-comparable evaluation; clinical utility and calibration in the intended deployment cohort are not established from the provided summary."

Evidence: PGS000662 (fine-mapped JAM; 269 variants) reports AUC 0.961; GWAS includes AFR/AMR/EAS/EUR with evaluation across AFR/EAS/EUR/MAE. Recommendation: Consider as an alternative when interpretability (fewer variants) or trans-ancestry derivation is prioritized. Caveats: AUC is reported without calibration and may not be directly comparable; covariate set differs (Age, 10 PCs)."

Evidence: PGS000333 reports AUC 0.788; DEV EUR; EVAL includes EUR/MAE. Recommendation: Use as a conservative baseline comparator and for sensitivity analyses against sparsity-based models. Caveats: Primarily EUR-developed; transfer to non-EUR populations may be limited without recalibration."

        "rationale": "Reasoning: Compact variant set (161) may be easier to implement and QC; includes integration context (pan-cancer PRS + modifiable risk factors). Evidence: PGS000795 reports AUC 0.769 and R² 0.51; evaluation EUR; incorporates family history covariate per summary. Recommendation: Consider when a small-panel PRS is required operationally, or as a benchmark alongside genome-wide methods. Caveats: Method description indicates reweighting from prior score; inclusion of family history in modeling may complicate isolation of PRS effect; unclear portability."
